## What the heck is a Fogent?

Howdy y'all,

I'm Javk Wick and welcome to Fogent.

Fogent is a generalizable Roleplay system that is intended to remove unneeded complexity while not sacrifice emergent/tactical gameplay. If you love the simplicity, flexibility, and narrative focus of Cogent Roleplay, but love tactical battle map combat, magic items, and sweet loot of D&D, than you are in the right place.
