# **Part 2: Tuntin**

Phandalin, a frontier town, is perched atop the remnants of a much older settlement. Centuries ago, the former Phandalin thrived as a bustling human town, firmly allied with the dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver's Pact. However, the same horde of marauders who plundered the mines at Wave Echo Cave razed the settlement, causing Phandalin to be abandoned and left in ruins for ages.

Over the past three or four years, resilient settlers from the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep embarked on the challenging mission of resurrecting the Phandalin of old. Out of these efforts, a thriving frontier town now stands, attracting a diverse array of inhabitants such as farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors, all enticed by tales of gold and platinum hidden within the nearby foothills of the Sword Mountains.

Regrettably, the lack of a local lord or authority to maintain order has also drawn its share of bandits and brigands. For the past two months, a gang known as the Redbrands has held sway over Phandalin, intimidating and coercing the town's populace. The gang's enigmatic leader is a figure known to the townsfolk as Glasstaff.

Upon the characters' initial arrival in Phandalin, present the following scene:

```
Your journey along the rutted track reveals the first glimpse of Phandalin. The town comprises around forty to fifty modest log buildings, some of which rest on ancient fieldstone foundations. The newer structures encircle the town's outskirts, intermingled with remnants of old ruins—crumbling stone walls now adorned with ivy and entwined in briars. These remnants are a testament to Phandalin's grandeur during past centuries.

Most of the contemporary buildings flank the cart track, which expands into a somewhat muddy main street as it ascends toward a dilapidated manor house situated on the eastern hillside of the town. As you draw near, you observe children at play on the town green, while townsfolk are preoccupied with their daily tasks, darting to and from shops. Many eyes briefly rise to acknowledge your presence but then return to their duties as you pass by.
```

If Sildar Hallwinter accompanies the party, add:

```
Sildar appears visibly more relaxed.

"My friends," he comments, "let's secure lodgings. I hear the local inn is quite charming."
```

Sildar's intention is to obtain some rest at the Stonehill Inn and subsequently launch an investigation throughout Phandalin in search of the missing wizard, Iarno Albrek. When his inquiry reaches an impasse, he organizes a meeting with Townmaster Harbin Wester (see the "Townmaster's Hall" section).

Throughout this phase of the adventure, the characters have the liberty to explore various locations in Phandalin and engage with the NPCs they encounter (see the "Town Description" section for more information). The town is small enough that one can traverse its length within a few minutes. However, given that the characters arrive late in the day, they won't have enough time to visit more than one or two locations before they must seek accommodations for the night.

Among the places the characters should consider visiting are:

**Barthen's Provisions.** If the characters bear the wagonload of supplies from the "Meet Me in Phandalin" adventure hook, they are directed to deliver it to this establishment.

**Lionshield Coster.** If the characters have retrieved the stolen goods from the Cragmaw hideout, they may wish to return them to their rightful owner.

**Stonehill Inn.** If Sildar Hallwinter accompanies the party, he recommends heading to this inn to secure lodgings. If the characters are in search of a place to dine and rest, they will find that the Stonehill Inn offers the best available options.

## Encounters in Tuntin

As the characters explore the town of Phandalin, you don't need to meticulously account for the time spent at each location. Instead, envision yourself as the director of an old-style western movie. Your aim is to depict various scenes where the adventurers enter a store or saloon and interact with the individuals present. Through these interactions, the adventurers uncover what the NPCs require or what information they are willing to share, allowing them to move on to the next location. These scenes represent a series of role-playing encounters that take place over a couple of days of in-game time.

To initiate, inquire where the players wish to go and what they intend to do in town. You might say, "There's an inn, a town hall, a shrine, general stores, and trading posts, along with a few other residences and businesses. Where would you like to visit?" Once the players have selected a location, reference the description in the following section, introduce the NPCs present, and initiate the interaction.

**The Stonehill Inn.** If the players are unsure about their characters' next steps, encourage them to commence at the Stonehill Inn. The NPCs here serve as guides, steering the characters towards various adventure opportunities and essential rumors accessible in other parts of the town. By patronizing the inn, the characters gain insight into other places they should explore.

**Redbrand Ruffians.** Sooner or later, the adventurers will cross paths with the toughs who dominate Phandalin. Your role is to determine when these ruffians make their appearance. Once the characters have had an opportunity to explore several locations in town and converse with the townsfolk, they may decide to track down the Redbrands. In such an event, you can execute the "Redbrand Ruffians" encounter. Alternatively, if the characters seem hesitant to confront the ruffians, the Redbrands may decide to seek them out at a moment of your choosing.

**Finding Cragmaw Castle.** The characters may express a desire to locate Cragmaw Castle to rescue Gundren Rockseeker. The majority of the townsfolk are preoccupied with the Redbrands, and no one in town possesses knowledge of Cragmaw Castle's whereabouts. Qelline Alderleaf, Sildar Hallwinter, and Halia Thornton can provide guidance on how the party might connect with someone who possesses knowledge about the castle's location.

## Important NPCs

Here is a brief summary of the most important NPCs in Phandalin and their relevance to the adventure:

1. **Toblen Stonehill (Innkeeper):** The proprietor of the Stonehill Inn, a central location in Phandalin where adventurers can gather information and secure lodging.
2. **Elmar Barthen (Trading Post Owner):** Operates a trading post and owes money to the party if you are using the "Meet Me in Phandalin" adventure hook.
3. **Daran Edermath (Order of the Gauntlet Member):** A member of the Order of the Gauntlet who has a quest for the party, providing an opportunity for adventurers to become involved in the order's activities.
4. **Linene Graywind (Trader):** Operates a trading post and offers a reward for retrieving her stolen supplies, motivating the party to engage with the town's troubles.
5. **Halia Thornton (Zhentarim Member):** A member of the Zhentarim with a quest for the party, introducing intrigue and opportunities to work with or against this faction.
6. **Qelline Alderleaf (Helpful Halfling Farmer):** A kind-hearted halfling farmer whose son, Carp, possesses knowledge of a secret entrance into the Redbrands' hideout, potentially aiding the party's efforts to deal with this troublesome gang.
7. **Sister Garaele (Elf Cleric of Tymora):** An elf cleric of Tymora and Harper agent with a quest for the party, furthering the adventurers' involvement with the Harper organization.
8. **Harbin Wester (Townmaster of Phandalin):** The townmaster of Phandalin who provides a quest for the party, prompting them to engage in town governance and security.
9. **Sildar Hallwinter (Lords' Alliance Member):** A member of the Lords' Alliance who offers two quests for the party, linking them with this influential faction and the search for the missing wizard, Iarno Albrek.

### Roleplaying Phandalin NPCs

If you're uncertain about how to portray an NPC, a great way to begin is to have the character introduce themselves, extend a warm welcome to the adventurers as they enter Phandalin, and inquire about their identities and intentions. You don't need to be a professional actor or a stand-up comedian to breathe life into your NPCs. However, if you'd like to add some flair, here are some helpful tips:

* **Relax:** Don't stress about impressing your players with your acting skills or humor. A natural portrayal of the character is often more engaging.
* **Understanding the NPCs:** Put yourself in the shoes of the NPCs. Consider how they might react to the characters and aim for realism in your responses.
* **Physical Expressions:** Utilize physical gestures and expressions to make your NPCs more vibrant. You can frown, grin, sneer, bat your eyelashes, pout, cross your eyes, or use other suitable body language to bring your NPCs to life.
* **Variety of Voices:** Experiment with different voices and speech patterns for your NPCs. You can draw inspiration from real-life accents, movie characters, or TV personalities. Adjust the volume and tone as needed to match the character's personality.
* **Player-Led Interactions:** Allow the players to take the lead in their interactions with the NPCs. This empowers them to shape the conversation and ask questions, promoting their engagement in the story.
* **Keep things moving:** It's important to note that the characters should have no reason to engage in combat with ordinary townsfolk. As a result, there's no need to provide game statistics for them. In the rare event that statistics become necessary, the commoner stat block can represent an adult NPC of any race.

## **Description of Phandalin**

Phandalin is a small town, which means the characters can explore various locations and interact with different NPCs throughout a single day. If the players decide to split up their characters, they can cover more ground, but you'll need to take turns managing interactions for each player. It's important to be aware that splitting the party can increase the potential danger of the "Redbrand Ruffians" encounter.

The subsequent sections provide specific details about various locations within the town.

### Stonehill Inn

```
At the heart of Phandalin stands a recently constructed roadhouse made of fieldstone and rough-hewn timbers. Inside, the common room buzzes with locals enjoying mugs of ale or cider, their curious eyes following your arrival.
```

This unassuming inn provides six rooms for rent, with one already occupied by Sildar Hallwinter. If the characters opt to stay at the Stonehill Inn, you can reference the "Food, Drink, and Lodging" section in the rulebook for pricing. Alternatively, they could camp outside of town or attempt to secure lodgings with farmers like Daran Edermath or Qelline Alderleaf.

The innkeeper is a friendly, short young human named Toblen Stonehill. Originally from the town of Triboar to the east, he came to Phandalin seeking mining opportunities. However, he soon discovered his true calling was innkeeping. Toblen holds mixed feelings about the Redbrands' reign of terror in the town and the lack of action from the townmaster, Harbin Wester. Despite his concerns, he refrains from stirring up trouble to protect his wife and children from potential Redbrand retaliation.

**Rumors at Stonehill Inn.** In the common room of the inn, characters can gather several useful leads by mingling with the townspeople and striking up conversations. The rumors circulating within the Stonehill Inn include:

* Narth, an elderly farmer, shares that "Sister Garaele, the overseer of the Shrine of Luck, recently returned to town, injured and fatigued."
* Elsa, a talkative barmaid, reveals that "Daran Edermath, the orchard keeper, is a former adventurer."
* Lanar, a miner, reports that "Ore raiders have been sighted at the east end of Triboar Trail, and the town master is searching for someone to handle the situation."
* Trilena, the innkeeper's wife, discloses the tragic story of Thel Dendrar, a local woodcarver who confronted the Redbrands and was subsequently murdered. She also reveals that Thel's family has gone missing. Unbeknownst to Trilena and the townsfolk, the Redbrands have taken Thel's wife and children to their hidden hideout.
* Pip, Toblen's young son, recounts Carp, Qelline Alderleaf's son, who discovered a secret tunnel in the woods, barely escaping the Redbrands' pursuit.
* Freda, a weaver, mentions that the Redbrands harass all the businesses in town, except for the Phandalin Miner's Exchange, as they don't want to provoke Halia Thornton, who runs it.

These rumors serve as valuable clues, guiding the characters toward various adventure opportunities in Phandalin. Furthermore, any of the inn's patrons can inform the characters that the Redbrands frequent the Sleeping Giant tap house on the town's eastern end, emphasizing the danger posed by these ruffians.

### **Barthen's Provisions**

Barthen's Provisions is the largest trading post in Phandalin. Its shelves are stocked with a wide range of everyday goods and supplies, including backpacks, bedrolls, rope, and rations. The store is open from sunrise to sunset and does not carry weapons or armor, but adventurers can find other essential gear here, provided the items cost less than 25 gp. When it comes to pricing, you can refer to the "Adventuring Gear" section in the rulebook.

The shop's proprietor is Elmar Barthen, a kind and slim human male shopkeeper who is around fifty years old. He employs two young clerks, Ander and Thistle, who assist with loading and unloading wagons and attending to customers when Barthen is absent.

**Delivering the Supplies.** If the characters initiated the adventure with the "Meet Me in Phandalin" hook, their task is to deliver a wagon filled with supplies to Barthen's. Upon arrival, Barthen pays the agreed-upon amount of 10 gp to each character and takes possession of the wagon and its supplies. Informed of Gundren Rockseeker's abduction, Barthen is deeply saddened and encourages the party to rescue the dwarf. He views Gundren as a friend and was enthusiastic about the prospect of uncovering the lost mine mentioned in the introduction. If the characters haven't already learned about the mine from Sildar Hallwinter, a character who passes a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check can provide information found in the first two paragraphs of the "Background" section.

Additionally, Barthen mentions that two more Rockseeker brothers, Nundro and Tharden, have been camping outside of town. However, he hasn't seen them in the past ten days and anticipates their return to resupply at any moment. Unbeknownst to Barthen, Tharden has passed away, and Nundro is held captive within the mine.

**Barthen's News.** If the characters inquire about the state of business in Phandalin, Barthen mentions that the Redbrands are making life difficult for everyone. They are extorting local businesses and defying the authority of the townmaster. If the characters express a desire to take action, he informs them that the Redbrands are regular patrons at the Sleeping Giant tap house.

### Edermath Orchard

Daran Edermath, a retired adventurer, resides in a charming cottage adjacent to an apple orchard. He is a robust half-elf, over a century old with striking silver hair. Daran served as a marshal and herald in the lands of the Dragon Coast, located far to the southeast. Upon retiring, he returned to the Neverwinter region, his place of origin.

Daran is a member of the Order of the Gauntlet, an organization dedicated to protecting others from the wrongdoings of evildoers. The Order is committed to maintaining vigilance, upholding justice, and ensuring retribution against those who seek to oppress or harm the innocent. Although he no longer actively serves the Order, Daran keeps a watchful eye on Phandalin's happenings. He readily exchanges information with fellow adventurers, particularly those who embody these virtues.

Daran expresses concern regarding the Redbrands and yearns for a group of adventurers to confront them. He believes it is time to challenge the Redbrands' leader, Glasstaff. Daran discloses to the characters that the Redbrands frequent the Sleeping Giant tap house but also reveals that their primary safe house is beneath Tresendar Manor on the town's eastern fringe.

**Quest: Old Owl Trouble.** Daran has learned through the stories of prospectors in the hills northeast of Phandalin that someone is excavating the ruins known as Old Owl Well. Even more disconcerting, several prospectors have reported being chased away by undead entities in the area. Daran urges the characters to visit the ruins, which are a couple of days' march to the northeast of Phandalin. Their task is to determine who is behind this activity and their intentions. Daran's concern lies with the ruins, an ancient watchtower of the Netheril magical empire, and the potential danger dormant within. If the party decides to pursue this quest, consult the "Old Owl Well" section for further details.

#### Joining the Order of the Gauntlet

For characters who engage with the Redbrands and explore Old Owl Well, Daran Edermath privately approaches certain members of the group, urging them to consider joining the Order of the Gauntlet. He targets those who align with the Order's values of honor and vigilance. If a character accepts, Daran bestows the title of Cheval upon them.

### Lionshield Coster

```
A wooden shield bearing a painted blue lion emblem hangs above the entrance of this unpretentious trading post.
```

This establishment belongs to the Lionshields, a merchant company headquartered in Yartar, over one hundred miles to the east. They supply finished goods to Phandalin and other smaller settlements in the region. Unfortunately, this particular outpost has suffered from bandit attacks. The most recent Lionshield caravan, destined for Phandalin, was waylaid and its cargo captured by Cragmaw goblins.

The head of the Phandalin post is Linene Graywind, a sharp-tongued human woman in her mid-thirties. Linene is aware of the banditry affecting Lionshield caravans but remains uncertain about the responsible parties.

In a back room, Linene maintains an inventory of armor and weapons available for sale to interested customers. Prices are detailed in the "Adventuring Gear" section in the rulebook. However, Linene has her principles and refuses to sell weapons to those she believes could threaten the town, including the Redbrands. She advises the characters to steer clear of the Sleeping Giant tap house.

**Recovered Goods.** If the characters successfully recover the stolen goods located in area 8 of the Cragmaw hideout (or if they left the goods but revealed their whereabouts), Linene rewards them with 50 gp and pledges her assistance to the adventurers in any way possible.

### Phandalin Miner's Exchange

The Miner's Exchange operates as a trading post where local miners have their valuable discoveries weighed, measured, and compensated. In the absence of local governance, the exchange serves as an unofficial records office, recording claims to various streams and excavations throughout the region. While Phandalin isn't experiencing a full-scale gold rush, hidden wealth in nearby streams and valleys supports numerous independent prospectors.

The guildmaster is Halia Thornton, a determined and strategic human woman. Her aspirations extend beyond mere commerce, and she acts as a de facto governing authority within the town. Additionally, Halia is an agent of the Zhentarim, an influential organization aiming to exert clandestine control over the North by means of wealth and influence. Halia works progressively to assert her influence in Phandalin and can become a valuable patron to the characters if they avoid conflicting with her.

Halia is unaware of Cragmaw Castle's location but has heard rumors that the Redbrands employ a goblin minion. She suggests the goblin might hold information about the castle's whereabouts. She leverages this information to persuade the characters to help her deal with the Redbrands.

**Quest: Halia's Job Offer.** In the event that characters she deems controllable approach her, Halia discloses the Redbrands' disruptive influence in town. She explains that the ruffians frequently loiter at the Sleeping Giant tap house and have an operational base underneath Tresendar Manor on the town's eastern border. She offers the characters 100 gp to eliminate the Redbrand leader, known as Glasstaff, and to secure any correspondence discovered in his quarters. Halia keeps her true intentions hidden, as she aims to take over the Redbrand operation herself. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals her ulterior motives.

#### Joining the Zhentarim

Should the party successfully eliminate the Redbrand leader, Halia Thornton takes the opportunity to approach specific members of the group and encourages them to consider joining the Zhentarim. She engages with those who share the Zhentarim's ambitions, which revolve around the pursuit of wealth and power. Even if the party completely dismantles the Redbrand gang, Halia may still make this offer with the intention of fostering allies and informants within the party. If a character agrees to join, Halia bestows upon them the title of Fang.

### Alderleaf Farm

Qelline Alderleaf, a wise and practical female halfling aged forty-five, is an astute farmer who seems to be privy to all the town's ongoings. She provides hospitable accommodation, offering the characters the option to stay in her hayloft if they prefer not to lodge at the Stonehill Inn.

**Carp's Tale.** Qelline's ten-year-old son, Carp, is a spirited and curious young halfling. Carp is captivated by the idea of becoming an adventurer and shares a fascinating story. He mentions that while he was playing in the woods near Tresendar Manor, he stumbled upon a concealed tunnel in a thicket. During his discovery, a couple of "big, menacing bandits" emerged from the tunnel, engaging with Redbrands in the vicinity. Thankfully, Carp managed to remain concealed from their view, but the situation was precarious. Carp believes that the bandits maintain a hidden lair beneath the old manor house. He can either guide the characters to the tunnel's entrance or provide them with directions. This tunnel leads directly to area 8 in the Redbrand hideout.

**Quest: Reidoth the Druid.** Qelline and Reidoth, a druid, share a longstanding friendship. If Qelline deduces that the characters are in search of specific locations such as Cragmaw Castle or Wave Echo Cave, she suggests they visit Reidoth for assistance since he possesses extensive knowledge of the land. Qelline informs the characters that Reidoth recently embarked on a journey to the Thundertree ruins, located just west of the Neverwinter Wood. These ruins are situated approximately fifty miles northwest of Phandalin. She provides detailed directions to help the characters locate this place. If the party pursues this quest, refer to the "Ruins of Thundertree" section for further information.

### Shrine of Luck

Phandalin's sole temple is a modest shrine constructed using stones collected from nearby ruins. It is dedicated to Tymora, the goddess of luck and good fortune.

The shrine is overseen by a scholarly acolyte named Sister Garaele, a fervent young elf who despairs of ever eradicating the Redbrands from Phandalin. Sister Garaele is a member of the Harpers, a widely distributed network of adventurers and spies committed to promoting equality and covertly opposing the abuse of power. The Harpers gather information throughout the land with the goal of thwarting tyrants and any faction, government, or group that amasses excessive power. They come to the aid of the weak, the poor, and the oppressed, always advocating for their well-being. Sister Garaele regularly reports on local events to her superiors.

**Quest: The Banshee's Bargain.** Sister Garaele was recently assigned a sensitive mission by her superiors. Her task was to persuade a banshee known as Agatha to respond to a question concerning a spellbook. Sister Garaele visited Agatha in her lair, but the banshee refused to appear for her. To facilitate communication, Garaele seeks an intermediary who will offer Agatha a suitable gift—a jeweled silver comb—and persuade the banshee to divulge information about the location of a spellbook that once belonged to a legendary mage named Bowgentle. Sister Garaele believes that a character capable of flattering Agatha's vanity might be able to secure the answer through this trade. She extends the quest to the characters and offers them three potions of healing as compensation for their efforts. If the party decides to undertake this quest, refer to the "Conyberry and Agatha's Lair" section for more details.

#### Joining the Harpers

Should the party assist Sister Garaele in uncovering the fate of Bowgentle's spellbook, she privately approaches specific members of the group, encouraging them to consider joining the Harpers. She focuses on individuals who embody the network's values and express a desire to bring about positive change through information and secrecy. If a character chooses to join, Sister Garaele confers upon them the title of Watcher.

### The Sleeping Giant

This dilapidated tap house is a grimy and perilous watering hole situated at the end of Phandalin's main street. It's a favorite haunt of Redbrand thugs and is managed by a cantankerous female dwarf named Grista. If the characters decide to visit this establishment, initiate the "Redbrand Ruffians" encounter.

### **The Town Master's Hall**

```
The town master's hall is a solid structure, adorned with sturdy stone walls, a sloping wooden roof, and a bell tower at the rear. A public notice, written in Common, is affixed to a board next to the front door. It announces, "REWARD - Orcs near Wyvern Tor! Those willing to confront the orc threat should inquire within." The notice is stamped with the town's seal and features an inscrutable signature.
```

Phandalin does not have a functioning government, but the residents elect a town master annually. The town master serves as an arbiter in minor disputes and manages any essential records. The present town master is Harbin Wester, a rotund and pompous elderly human who works as a banker. However, he is entirely cowed by the Redbrands and dismisses them as "just a group of mercenaries, not much trouble, really."

The town master's hall includes a small yet functional jail in its cellar, featuring two cells. Harbin holds the keys to these cell doors.

**Quest: Ore Trouble.** Harbin seeks a group willing to venture east on the Triboar Trail, as travelers have reported issues with a band of orcs near Wyvern Tor. He offers a 100 gp reward to any party capable of resolving the problem. For further details about this quest, consult "Wyvern Tor" on page 35.

**Quest: Finding Cragmaw Castle.** After resting at the Stonehill Inn, Sildar Hallwinter takes up residence at the town master's hall. In his role as a representative of the Lords' Alliance, his aim is to restore law and order to Phandalin. He intends to locate the lost mine of Wave Echo Cave and assist the Rockseeker brothers in bringing it back into operation, believing that this would foster prosperity in the region and civilize the town.

Sildar also encourages the characters to maintain pressure on the Cragmaw goblins. He offers a 500 gp reward to the party if they can locate Cragmaw Castle and defeat or expel the tribe's chieftain. Sildar suggests that the party could find the castle by scouting the lands surrounding the Triboar Trail for further raiding parties (refer to "Wilderness Encounters" in the "Triboar Trail" section of part 3).

**Quest: Finding Iarno.** Upon questioning several locals, Sildar learns that Iarno Albrek, another member of the Lords' Alliance, vanished while exploring the area around Tresendar Manor approximately two months ago, shortly after arriving in Phandalin. Sildar enlists the characters' help in investigating the manor and its surroundings to locate and retrieve Iarno, or whatever remains of him if something has befallen him. Sildar describes Iarno as "a short, dark-bearded human wizard in his thirties."

Unknown to Sildar, Iarno established the Redbrands, became their leader, and adopted the alias Glasstaff to conceal his true identity (a moniker earned due to his glass staff). Upon discovering the truth about Iarno, Sildar expresses a desire to have the wizard apprehended and transported to Neverwinter to face judgment by higher authorities. Regardless of Iarno's fate, Sildar rewards the party with 200 gp for eliminating the Redbrand threat.

#### **Joining the Lords' Alliance**

If the party successfully deals with the goblin threat from Cragmaw Castle or uncovers Iarno's deception, Sildar Hallwinter discreetly approaches certain members of the group, urging them to consider joining the Lords' Alliance. He engages with individuals who aspire to uphold civilization through proactive measures. If a character decides to join, Sildar Hallwinter confers upon them the title of Cloak.

### **Tresendar Manor**

More fortress than residence, Tresendar Manor stands at the eastern outskirts of town, positioned atop a low hill amid woods and thickets. Although the ancient manor has been abandoned for a long time, its cellars have been converted into a stronghold for the Redbrands. If the characters decide to investigate this location, they will find the entrance to the Redbrand hideout.

## **Redbrand Ruffians**

It's almost inevitable that a confrontation with the Redbrands occurs within a day or two of the adventurers' arrival in Phandalin. Several scenarios can trigger this confrontation:

1. If the characters decide to confront the Redbrands at the Sleeping Giant tap house after speaking with several NPCs in town.
2. If the characters choose to investigate Tresendar Manor.
3. If the party shows no interest in the Redbrands, a gang of ruffians seeks them out and provokes a fight in the street, often as they are leaving a location in town.

### **Confrontation**

If the characters decide to confront the Redbrands at the Sleeping Giant, you can describe the scene as follows:

```
The Sleeping Giant is a dilapidated tavern at the eastern end of town. Four surly human ruffians loiter on the covered porch, sitting on empty ale barrels or leaning against the wall. They are all adorned in grimy crimson cloaks, and their scowling gazes are fixed on you as you approach.

One of the thugs spits on the ground. "Well, well," he sneers. "Here's a whole bunch of little pups. What's your business here, pups? Did you come to yap at us?"
```

If the Redbrands confront the characters in the street, describe it as follows:

```
As you step back into the street, you notice four armed ruffians waiting for you. They are all humans dressed in filthy red cloaks, their hands on their weapons as they observe you.

One of the ruffians spits on the ground. "It's time to clear out, strangers. Hand over your belongings and be on your way."
```

Continue the insults and provocations as long as you see fit. The Redbrands will attack within a round or two if the characters do not initiate combat. Neither side should be surprised, given the tension and the clear signs of an impending confrontation.

The group consists of four Redbrand ruffians. If three of them are defeated, the last one will flee toward Tresendar Manor.

#### **Developments**

Redbrands who are captured or charmed by the characters can provide valuable information (see "What the Redbrands Know" sidebar on page 20). While Townmaster Harbin Wester may not want to retain Redbrand prisoners until he is certain the entire gang has been eradicated, the characters can persuade or intimidate him into detaining any captured Redbrands for at least a few days.

If the characters kill the ruffians, most of the townspeople will be appreciative. An exception is the town master, who is concerned about the possibility of Redbrand retaliation. Harbin will not punish the characters but will caution them against causing further trouble.

#### **Awarding Experience Points**

Each character is awarded a skill point upon their successful defeat of the ruffians.

> **Guiding the Players**
>
> Following the "Redbrand Ruffians" encounter, the players should sense the necessity of addressing the remaining gang. If it appears the characters are uncertain about their next course of action, one of the NPCs they've previously encountered in town should take the initiative. This NPC can explicitly suggest investigating the Redbrand hideout and direct them toward Tresendar Manor.
>
> However, if the players express a preference for pursuing alternative leads in the region, it's acceptable to proceed to part 3 of the adventure and allow the ruffians to remain a pending matter. Upon the characters' return to Phandalin, ensure it's evident that the Redbrands are creating escalating issues, underscoring the urgency of dealing with them.

## Lavendar Lancer Hideout

The Redbrands' headquarters in Phandalin occupies an underground complex beneath the now-dilapidated Tresendar Manor. Originally, the manor's cellars were designed for the safe storage of provisions, including food and water, in case the estate came under attack. Adjacent to the cellars was a crypt intended for interring deceased members of the Tresendar family. The Redbrands, however, have substantially expanded the cellars to serve their own needs, modifying them to accommodate slave pens, workshops, and barracks. Should the characters initiate their search from Tresendar Manor, their entry point into the dungeon is in area 1. Alternatively, if they opt to follow Carp Alderleaf through the secret tunnel he discovered, they gain access to the dungeon via area 8.

### **General Features**

The hideout boasts well-constructed dungeon chambers featuring flagstone floors and walls made of dressed stone blocks. The western end of the complex is situated at a lower level than the eastern end, and staircases guide the characters as they explore.

**Ceilings.** The height of passages and chambers is typically 10 feet, unless otherwise specified.

**Doors.** All doors within the complex are crafted from wood and equipped with iron handles, hinges, and built-in locks. By default, the doors are unlocked, unless the text states otherwise. Both Iarno Albrek (area 12) and a bugbear named Mosk (area 9) carry an iron key that can be used to lock or unlock every door within the complex. Lock-picking is possible with thieves' tools and a successful DC 10 Dexterity check, and doors can be forcefully broken down with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

**Secret Doors.** The map for the Redbrand Hideout is marked with an "S" to indicate the placement of secret doors. These doors are constructed from stone and blend seamlessly with the surrounding walls. Detecting a secret door from a distance of up to 10 feet without actively searching for it requires a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher. A character who actively searches the wall can uncover the secret door with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. These secret doors swing open on concealed iron hinges and are not locked.

**Light.** Most areas within the hideout are illuminated by oil lamps affixed to wall sconces, which are refilled every few hours as necessary.

> **What the Redbrands Know**
>
> If the characters charm or successfully interrogate any of the Redbrands, they can acquire valuable information, including the hideout's location under Tresendar Manor and the following insights:
>
> 1. The leader of the Redbrands is a human wizard named Glasstaff, whose nickname originates from his staff, made entirely of glass.
> 2. The Black Spider, a mysterious figure, has hired the Redbrands to deter adventurers and intimidate the local population. The reasons behind these actions remain unknown. Bugbears have been dispatched by the Black Spider to reinforce the Redbrands and provide additional strength.
> 3. The lower section of the complex is guarded by a grotesque "eye monster."
> 4. The Redbrands hold several captives in a location "near the old crypts," which are safeguarded by skeletons.

### **1. Cellar**

Upon exploring the manor grounds, the characters discover the abandoned building. Tracks lead to a stone staircase near a dilapidated kitchen, and at the bottom of these stairs is an unlocked door leading to the cellar. Upon opening the door, provide the following description:

"The door opens onto a five-foot-wide landing fifteen feet above a large cellar, with stone steps descending to the floor in two short flights. Another door stands beneath the stairs to the north. A large stone cistern occupies the western part of the room, whose walls are lined with kegs and barrels."

This room is a spacious storage cellar, well-suited to the underhanded activities of the Redbrands. Although barrels contain fresh provisions, there is nothing in this room that suggests the Redbrands' presence.

The barrels house supplies like salted pork and beef, flour, sugar, apples, and ale. Vigilantly searching the barrels is a noisy endeavor that could alert the Redbrands in area 2.

 **Cistern** : The rectangular cistern holds cold, fresh water, is 10 feet deep, and features a rim 2 feet higher than the surrounding floor. Drain pipes from the manor's roof provide the cistern with water. A waterproof satchel, hidden from plain sight underwater, is attached to a submerged rope along the south cistern wall. It can be discovered with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check or by a character probing the cistern with a pole or jumping in. The satchel contains valuable items detailed in the "Treasure" section.

 **Secret Door** : A secret door can be found in the southwest corner of the room, as indicated on the Redbrand Hideout map.

**Developments**

This area does not feature any monsters or villains. However, the ruffians in area 2 will become aware of any excessive noise here. They may sneak into the room, gaining the element of surprise if the characters are unaware of their presence.

If a confrontation occurs in this area, and two of the ruffians are defeated, the last ruffian may reveal the secret door as they flee in that direction.

**Treasure**

The waterproof satchel concealed in the cistern contains a potion of healing, a potion of invisibility, 50 gp, and a clean set of ordinary travel clothing. This is a getaway kit that Iarno keeps in the cellar for emergencies.
