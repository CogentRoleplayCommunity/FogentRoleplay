Fogent Todos:

Rethink how off guard works, maybe versus perception check

Shove for mental damage magic

Possible dedicated 1 handed swords

Cover might need to be a resistance instead of AC

INvestigate lvl 5 only victory levels to avoid overcoming complete resistance

Decouple items and Item shop from fallen

Figure out cost of upgrading weapons with smithing stones

Maybe rebalance magic as temporary weapon summons, magic upcasting only works after the initial investment


Fallen Todos:

Remove NotMyImage and Copyright tags

Make Asclepius stat block, probably just a snake

Fix Characters Items and Tier of play

Be super clear which races start with which Fellcraft

Fun Ideas:

Runecraft tattoo stuff and enemies

Item Creation - Apprentice -> 1-3 Adept -> 4-6 Expert -> 7-9 Master -> 10-12

Add javk magic arm item

Add Javk Misericord

Add brotherhood of silver lore

Remove Fellkin in general. Gives the races more uniqueness. The group name could be "the Fallen".

Grass lord one shot

make videos about character making

Write the Beast Of Reddwall

Investigate reverse turn order
