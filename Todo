## Fogent Todo:
- Fix Gun Ranges
- Add shields to generic magic
- Add Rules for taking a negative in a skill to gains skill points
- Bite Grab
- Rebuild all sheets, new weights, new movement speeds, new magic, new character sheet with links
- No auto-succeed spells, instead all spells are attemptable but they have higher levels, not sure if good idea
- Dual Thrown weapons have +1d6
- Split Martial Vocations from Magic Vocations
- Determine if the Magic Skill Roll in the declaration phase is factored into the resulting combat roll/saving throw spell DC. Spell save DC is just skill roll versus will/lift, but if the CL for the spell isn't achieved for the caster, the spell never goes off

## Fogent Maybe To Dos:
- maybe double Magic Resource
- Possible -1d6 nerf to all ranged weapons
- Possible dedicated 1 handed swords
- Investigate reverse turn order
- Shove for mental damage magic
- Should EO tick for each character engaged, or each character engaged and each character that engages them
- Different Arrows and bolts for different weapons
- Light Crossbow and heavy Crossbow in one hand

## Fallen To dos:
- Remove NotMyImage and Copyright tags
- Make Asclepius stat block, probably just a snake
- Be super clear which races start with which Fellcraft
- Figure out cost of upgrading weapons with smithing stones
- Runecraft tattoo stuff and enemies
- Add brotherhood of silver lore
- Remove Fellkin in general. Gives the races more uniqueness. The group name could be "the Fallen".
- Grass lord one shot
- Write the Beast Of Reddwall
- Add entangle spell
- make videos about character making
- Figured out spellbook mechanic, maybe it isn't a magic focus but a book for spells
