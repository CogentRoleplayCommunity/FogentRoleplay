## Fogent Todo:
- Carry Weight should scale off of dice pool size, investigate if gaining 40, 50, or 60 lbs per dice is approrate. Also might wanna change the carry weight percent breakpoints to 30% for light weight
- Fix Gun Ranges
- Recalculate all movement speeds
- Fix player characters Spears and magic ranges and monsters

## Fogent Maybe To Dos:
- maybe double Magic Resource
- Possible -1d6 nerf to all ranged weapons
- Possible dedicated 1 handed swords
- Investigate reverse turn order
- Shove for mental damage magic
- Maybe have magic resource scale off of level
- Should EO tick for each character engaged, or each character engaged and each character that engages them
- Maybe add shields to generic magic

## Fallen To dos:
- Remove NotMyImage and Copyright tags
- Make Asclepius stat block, probably just a snake
- Be super clear which races start with which Fellcraft
- Figure out cost of upgrading weapons with smithing stones
- Runecraft tattoo stuff and enemies
- Add brotherhood of silver lore
- Remove Fellkin in general. Gives the races more uniqueness. The group name could be "the Fallen".
- Grass lord one shot
- Write the Beast Of Reddwall
- Add entangle spell
- make videos about character making
- Figured out spellbook mechanic, maybe it isn't a magic focus but a book for spells
