## Fogent Todos
- Fix Gun Ranges
- Make more variation with Mag. Ranged weapons with different ammunition types.
- make videos about character making
- Have 1 person try to sit down and run the game without Jack's help. The video series should support this.
- Do some graphic design on the character sheet at some point
- Grapple disarm might need to only be advantage and disadvantage for the opponent

## Fogent Maybe To Dos:
- Should EO tick for each character engaged, or each character engaged and each character that engages them
- Different Arrows and bolts for different weapons
- Bite Grab/Tentacle and minor injury from medium injury
