## Fogent Todos
- Fix Gun Ranges
- Make more variation with Mag. Ranged weapons with different ammunition types.
- make videos about character making
- Have 1 person try to sit down and run the game without Jack's help. The video series should support this.
- Do some graphic design on the character sheet at some point
- Grapple disarm might need to only be advantage and disadvantage for the opponent
- Destiny Resistance
“Every villain is a hero of his own story.”


Some have wills strong enough to resist the pull of destiny. Destiny points cannot be spent after a roll against creatures that have this perk.

Destiny Immunity
“Our Destiny is not written for us, but by us.”


Some have wills so strong they are immune to the pull of destiny. Destiny points cannot be spent against creatures that have this perk.



## Fogent Maybe To Dos:
- Should EO tick for each character engaged, or each character engaged and each character that engages them
