## Fogent Todo:
- Fix Gun Ranges
- Figured out spellbook mechanic, maybe it isn't a magic focus but a book for spells
- Maybe have magic resource scale off level
- Moved STagger under off guard

## Fogent Maybe To Dos:
- maybe double Magic Resource
- maybe Hold person just works with Magic Skill versus willpower roll. Save happens initially during the action round, with each save happening during declaration phase.
- Possible -1d6 nerf to all ranged weapons
- Possible dedicated 1 handed swords
- Hew sword for Falchion
- Added Net with 5/15 range
- Investigate reverse turn order
- Shove for mental damage magic
- Item Creation - Apprentice -> 1-3 Adept -> 4-6 Expert -> 7-9 Master -> 10-12
- Here is a handy equation I made for calculating custom Cones. "A" is area, "D" is distance, and theta is the angle closest to the caster. Simply plug in the Area for your dice roll, and either "D" or theta. Whatever you didn't plugin will be calculated. If none of this makes sense, brush up on your trigonometry or just use the default cones above!

## Fallen To dos:
- Fix player characters Spears and magic ranges and monsters
- Remove NotMyImage and Copyright tags
- Make Asclepius stat block, probably just a snake
- Be super clear which races start with which Fellcraft
- Figure out cost of upgrading weapons with smithing stones
- Runecraft tattoo stuff and enemies
- Add brotherhood of silver lore
- Remove Fellkin in general. Gives the races more uniqueness. The group name could be "the Fallen".
- Grass lord one shot
- Write the Beast Of Reddwall
- Add entangle spell
- make videos about character making
