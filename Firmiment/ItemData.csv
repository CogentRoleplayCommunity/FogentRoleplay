This excellent slender bastard sword is perfectly balanced. Nimble, thin, and razor sharp.

A relatively unknown Runecraft to the wider populace, this sword is highly debated by scholars of war and Runecrafts. ""Ending"", ""Epilogue"", ""The Last Word"", ""An Ending to things"", ect… are all names for what scholars believe is the same sword recorded across many myths from various cultures, long into the past. Always described as a slender, long, graceful sword as easy to use in one hand as two. This sword seems to end up in the hands of ill fated rogues and rebels.

Killing with this weapon seems to mysteriously decapitate the victim's head from their bodies. In some tales it is only when the user of the sword deals a killing blow, while in older tales a single nick from the blade would lead to instant decapitation. Users report seeing flashes of the life they’ve cut off and all the generations in an instant.

 Appearing in various forms throughout history such as a rapier or slender long sword. This has led some scholars to argue that this sword is in fact multiple swords with similar effects. The Battle Scholars of the Dawn Empire had this weapon in their great collection in Crossroads long ago, and it was mysteriously lost. They recorded the weapon as only decapitating on a death blow, testing it on condemned criminals. Such a weak effect led to reduced research on the weapon while it was in their possession. However, they never were able to replicate its Runecraft, odd for such a weak effect. No weapon has ever been recorded as having a similar effect, leaving some scholars to ponder if there is more to this Runecraft…",21/21,Excellent

An echo of the past in the future. I can hear it dear sister, can't you…"" - Lord Maxwell Reddington

The arming sword of Lord Maxwell Reddington, taken from the crypt underneath Castle Tearstone.

Lord Maxwell Reddington was heir to House Reddington and to the Kingdom of Reddland. Maxwell was an academic of Byrgenwerth, like his sister Veronica, and was fascinated by the ancient culture of the Siren’s who used to call Reddwall their own. He spent much of his time and dowry funding expeditions into the ancient Siren catacombs that Reddwall stand up today. On one of these expeditions with his younger sister Lady Veronica Reddington, they discovered something deep within the catacombs. Maxwell returned with this sword and Veronica shortly after invented the first healing bloods of Reddwall.

After that fateful day, Maxwell began to worship the Moon Presence. On a diplomatic mission to Crossroads with his sister, Maxwell had an apparent mental breakdown. He raved and blasphemed the Bright Lord in front of the Emperor, and was sentenced to death for his heresy. Veronica was held hostage and war between Reddland and the Empire almost erupted. However, an outlaw pirate Lord known as the Laughing Storm blockaded the Iris Sea and promised to burn and pillage all vessels until Veronica was safely released.

In the end, peace was agreed upon between the two powers. Veronica was barren, so it was agreed the next heir of Reddwall would be bound to the next heir of the Dawn Empire, unifying countries in blood. The entire event was later known as “The Red Blasphemy”.

The Laughing Storm, one of the greatest pirate lords and outlaws to have ever lived, turned himself over to the Reddland navy voluntarily. Sentenced to death, he was pardoned by the now Lady Veronica Reddington for his efforts in her rescue but was indebted to serve Lady Veronica for the rest of his life. Flint Storm served faithfully as Veronica’s advisor and admiral of the Reddland Navy, until their eventual unexpected marriage.

Veronica and Flint tried for children many times, but tragedy struck every time. After years of trying, Veronica eventually bore a sickly heir, a daughter with hair as white as the full moons.",24/24,Superior

The Spear of Destiny, a massive artifact Swordspear,  is the most famous artifact on the continent. The Spear was first wielded by the Amon, Spear of the Brights, in service of The Bright Lord. Though in time, Amon would use the Spear in an attempt to overthrow The Bright Lord.

Eventually the Spear would end up in the possession of the Royal Family of the Dawn Empire, passed down to a sibling of the current Emperor. The siblings would wield the Spear as Amon did for their new emperor. For it is said that whoever wields the spear of Destiny influences the destiny of the world.

Whatever their heart truly desires will begin to manifest in the world. This is regardless of what the users think they want, it is what they truly desire.If the spear is claimed from combat or stolen by another, then the loser loses all their power. They will die in the coming days of mysterious causes.

The most famous of these was Booker Twins, the Golden Patriot. Seen as a symbol of strength and honor to the people of the Dawn Empire. Those that oppose the Dawn Empire had a much different perspective…",48/48,Artifact

A mythic arcane longsword discovered by the first Sirens who first inhabited what is known as Reddland today. Said to be a sign of divine favor to those chosen by the Moon Presence of Terra. As a manifestation of the Moon Presence on Terra, the wielder gains access to the wisdom and power of the moon presence.

When moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. Few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort.

Princess Vex'ahlia Reddington was gifted this sword upon her return to Reddland by her mother, who claimed it was her birth right. Lady Reddington used to tell tales of Vex'ahlia's birth. Lady Reddington wanted nothing more than a child, so when her medical and academic knowledge failed her, she prayed to the Moon Presence to protect the unborn child within her. Vex'ahlia was born with white hair the color of the full moon. One night when Lady Veronica went to check on the baby Vex'ahlia, this sword was leaning up against her crib playing the most wonderful lullaby she'd ever heard.",48/48,Artifact
