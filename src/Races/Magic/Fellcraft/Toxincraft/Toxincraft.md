#### Specialization: Dragonvenom

Dragon Venom is legendary in its destructive capabilities. Dragons channel from the elemental scales that cover their bodies. Any affected by the powerful neurotoxin are instantly paralyzed.

Dragon venom never degrades or dries out. It is tasteless and odorless, making it a preferred tool of assassins. Common antivenoms have zero effect on it. A person affected with the venom has visible black veins visible through their skin as the necrotic effects kill from within.

Toxins can be used to absorb Ichor. If the toxin is already within the user, they may absorb it.

#### Toxin/Poison Resistance
