Harpies trace their monstrous ancestry from the ancient avian monsters that bowed to the Bright Lord. These monsters were grafted consciousness and the form of the Bright Lord.

Know as a generally a nomadic warlike people, Harpies rarely found amoung the terrestial races of Terra or as the Harpies call them, "low landers". Traveler's may encounter Harpies while explore biomes of great verticallity such as The Spine of the World or the numerous floating islands that dot the sky of Terra.

From an early age, Harpies begin mastering the use of Galecraft, as flight is a core being and nessesary for survival.
