Chitinkin (or Kiki as they call themselves) trace their ancestry from the ancient insectoid monsters that bowed to the Bright lord. These monsters were granted consciousness and the form of the Bright Lord.

## Distinctive Physical Features

Distinctive features of Chitinkin are their exoskeleton exteriors and insectoid-like traits.

## Culture

Most Chitinkin dwell deep within the earth in massive colonies that span the massive underground caverns under the surface of Terra. Their societies are heavily influenced by their biology, with their purpose and job dictated by the needs of the collective.

In each Chitinkin city dwells a queen who has powerful Mindcraft that allows her to influence the wills of the non-royal population.  The majority of the Chitinkin are workers that harvest the vast underground mushroom farms and expand the colony. Those that are born into the royal cast are resistant to the queen's influence. They serve as generals, advisors, dukes, and other jobs that require creativity and  self-will.

The largest of these Colonies in the Hive is located in Caurus. The Chitinkin that live on the outskirts of the colonies devoid of the queenâ€™s influence live hard nomadic lives. They stay far away from the colonies as venturing to close might tempt their minds.
