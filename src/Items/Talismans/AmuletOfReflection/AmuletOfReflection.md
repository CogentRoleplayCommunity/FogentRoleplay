### Apparel Storage

This small mirror can save an outfit the user is wearing. If no outfit is stored inside the user will appear naked in the reflection while holding it. Pressing the mirror while looking into it will swap your apparel between your reflection and what you are currently wearing. This happens in a flash of light, similar to the glare off a mirror. This allows the users to store an outfit inside of the necklace.
