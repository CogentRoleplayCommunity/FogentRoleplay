# Vocations

Vocations represent your character's job, class, or life path. You should check with your Narrator to make sure that your Vocation exists in the setting. Some traditional fantasy examples Vocations are Rogue, Knight, Wizard, Paladin, Cleric, etc... Other examples include Vagrant, Chef, or Sailor. Each vocation has one or many Governing Attributes that logically would govern it.

## Vocation Skills

All skills under a Vocation have their levels capped by the Vocation's level. For instance, if a character had a level 2 Vocation, any skill under it couldn't increase above 2, until its Vocation level increased.

Each skill under a Vocation has one or many Governing Attributes that logically would govern it. A skill under a Vocation can have different Governing Attributes than the Vocation's Governing Attributes. Two kinds of skills fall under a Vocation, Vocational Skills and Combat Skills.

### Combat Skills

Combat skills include all Weapon Combat Skills and Magic Skills. These skills require skill points to be increased.

### Vocational Skills

Vocational Skills are skills that your Vocation would logically give you. A Vocational Skill's level is inherited from Vocation's level. Players can make Vocational Skills at any point with approval from the Narrator and use them for applicable skill checks.

Vocational Skills will often overlap with one or more Core Skills, though they will represent a much more specialized subset of tasks. Often times a Vocational Skill will combine what would usually be multiple sequential harder Core Skill checks into a single often easier Vocational Skill check.

Vocational Skills can never cover a majority of what a Core Skill covers. You can not assist Vocational Skills with the Vocation they fall under, as they are essentially relying on the same shared skill point investment.

It is smart to write down Vocational Skills under your vocation as a reminder to have on your character sheet.

#### Vocational Skills Examples

Below are some example of Vocational Skills for certain Vocations with examples of the sequence of Core Skills that would be used if a character didn't have the Vocational Skill in question.

|    Baker    |                                                Baking (Dexterity and General Knowledge)                                                |

## Example Vocation

Our example character has 0 STR, 1 RFX, and 1 INT. I take the Vocation "Chef" and give it the Governing Attributes of RFX and INT. RFX makes sense as chefs have to use their senses to smell, taste, and quick fine motor control of their hands. INT makes sense as they have to have a vast knowledge of recipes and flavor combinations. I increase the Vocation level to level 2. My "Chef" vocation dice pool is 7d6.

I add the "Wine Tasting" Vocational Skill and give it the Governing Attributes of RFX and INT. RFX makes sense as they'd have to use their sense to smell and taste for the wine. INT makes sense as they'd have to have a vast knowledge of wine types and have knowledge of what were good years when the grapes were grown. "Wine Tasting" is also not covered by any other Core Skill. I inherited the level for "Wine Tasting" at level 2 as it shares the level of my "Chef" vocation.

I try to make "Chopping Food" a vocational skill and give it the governing attribute RFX. RFX makes sense as they'd have to use fine motor control with their hands to chop quickly.

I try to add the "Small Blade" combat skill which has the governing attributes STR, RFX, and INT. This makes sense as being stronger, faster, and smarter makes you more deadly with a knife. It also makes sense that a Chef would know how to use a knife. I spend 1 skill point on it, bringing it to level 1.

I try and add the "Reach Spear" combat skill. I realized using a long spear is not something that a chef would do, so I can't add it under my vocation.

| Chef             |   RFX, INT   |     2     | 7d6 |
| ---------------- | :-----------: | :-------: | :-: |
| Wine Tasting     |   RFX, INT   | Inherited | 7d6 |
| Chopping Food    |      RFX      | Inherited | 6d6 |
| Small Blade      | STR, RFX, INT |     1     | 7d6 |
| ~~Reach Spear~~ | STR, RFX, INT |          |    |
