# Dodge Roll

When a combat roll is made against a character who is not capable of making an opposing combat roll, the defender can make an Dexterity Roll vs the attacker's Combat Roll. This is an assumed reflexive action, IE a character could have, as part of the Declaration Phase, declared"... and I'll try to dodge anything being shot at me" every round. Any levels over the defender's Dodge Roll wins count as victories for the attacker. The only victory level outcome a Dodge can achieve is exiting a grapple. A Combat Roll and Dodge Roll can both be made in a round.
