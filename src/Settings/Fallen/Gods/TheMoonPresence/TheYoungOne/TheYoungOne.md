## Lore

Many inhabitants of Terra hold reverence for the Moon Presence, considering it a primal force that predates even the arrival of the Bright Lord. Legends speak of a time when the Moon Presence was whole, but during the Great Betrayal, the epic clash between Amon and the Bright Lord caused the moon to fracture, splitting it into two separate entities.

The smaller of the two moons that adorn the celestial expanse of Terra. Revered as the gentler aspect of the Moon Presence, the Younger moon is associated with benevolent influences, such as guiding sailors safely home, ensuring the well-being of pregnant mothers, and bringing forth gentle tides.
