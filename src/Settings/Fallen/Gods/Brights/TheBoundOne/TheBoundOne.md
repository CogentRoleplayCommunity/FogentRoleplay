"With no respite from the outside world, the Bound One could only look within. And there it found the gentle embrace of an infinite dream..."

During the Awakening of Terra, the Bound One introduced the concepts of rest, sleep, and relaxation. Followers of the Bound One seek enlightenment not through worldly concerns but through deep relaxation and dreams. These devotees, known as Bound Apostles, don heavy robes and chains, surrendering themselves to endless slumber. They awaken only to share the secrets and innovations discovered within their dreams. Many of the mystical runes used throughout Terra today were uncovered through this ethereal connection.

Description:
There exist no personal accounts of the Bound One. Depictions of the Bound One in cathedral statues portray a formless figure bound in chains, devoid of distinguishable features. Often depicted slumped forward or lying on the ground, the Bound Oneâ€™s representation evokes a sense of stillness and tranquility.
