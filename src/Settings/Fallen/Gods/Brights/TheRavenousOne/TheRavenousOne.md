## Lore

During the creation of Terra, The Ravenous One bestowed upon Fellkind an unquenchable hunger for life, a primal drive to indulge and devour, lest they wither away. The Ravenous One desires the people of Terra to fully embrace their voracious nature and consume the world around them, for in their consumption lies their survival...

Depicted in various cultures across Terra, The Ravenous One is often represented as an immense maw filled with teeth or mandibles, symbolizing insatiable hunger. Devotees of The Ravenous One include the Chitinkin, hunters, farmers, chefs, starving peasants, and indulgent lords and ladies.

Priests and priestesses of The Ravenous One are known for their plumpness and travel the world, imparting their knowledge of hunting, farming, land clearing, and culinary arts. Wherever they go, abundance and bountiful harvests tend to follow in their wake.
