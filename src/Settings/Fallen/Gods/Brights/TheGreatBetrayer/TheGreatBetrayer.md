## Lore

The Great Betrayer, known as Amon the Faithful One prior to the cataclysmic event that forever tainted his name, stood as the Bright Lord's most loyal servant. Bestowed with the Spear of Destiny by his master, Amon faithfully served the Bright Lord until his dramatic and sudden betrayal.

The name "Amon" has since become a curse, a foreboding omen not to be uttered lightly. Today, he is widely referred to as "The Great Betrayer" on Terra, with worship strictly forbidden. However, many temples still preserve teachings and house statues of Amon, acknowledging his enduring status within the Bright Pantheon.

By all accounts, Amon was considered the most dangerous of all the Brights, owing to his mysterious ability to adapt his power to match any adversary before him. Scholars are perplexed by the abundance of ancient records chronicling his time living among and protecting the early Fellkind. Some texts even describe him as sharing similarities in stature and strength with Fellkind. Myths recount his legendary battles against the Demon Lords of Terra, depicting him as an unstoppable force of relentless might.

Amon's Mark, known as "The Mark/Brand of the Undying" is referenced in numerous ancient texts. While the exact nature of this mark remains elusive, it is believed to render Amon virtually invincible, endowing him with great power.

Amon's profound affinity for weaponry and equipment is evident, as he is credited with teaching our ancestors the use of many weapons still employed today. Artifacts associated with Amon are closely guarded within the capital of the Dawn Empire, Crossroads. However, whispers persist of lost artifacts, swallowed by the tides of timeâ€¦
