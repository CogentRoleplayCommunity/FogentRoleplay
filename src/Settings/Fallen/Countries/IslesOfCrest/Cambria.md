# Cambria

A year and a half ago, Cambria suffered one of the most severe shard epidemics in recorded history. A coordinated group of sentient monsters descended upon the town during twilight. Out of the 585 residents, only two lost their lives, while the remaining inhabitants were subjected to a fate far worse than death. The entire population of the town was infected with shards, prompting the intervention of the Inquisition of the Dawn Empire. From that point on, Cambria was placed under constant surveillance, and each resident was provided with a hearthstone, a simple enchantment that would alert the authorities upon their demise.

It was expected that all the residents, except for a brother and sister, would succumb to the shards within the first year.
