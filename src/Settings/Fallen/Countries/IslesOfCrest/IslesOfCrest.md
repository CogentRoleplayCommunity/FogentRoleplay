# Isles of Crest

The Isles of Crest are governed by a loose coalition of Beastkin tribes, each holding territorial control over different parts of the various isles. Annually, the leaders of these tribes gather at Starfall, the largest city in the Crest Isles, which was built around a fallen star revered as sacred by the Beastkin. This assembly serves as a forum to discuss matters of trade, defense, and elect a representative who will serve as a senator, representing their collective interests in the Imperial senate.

The islanders tend to keep to themselves, although encounters with young groups of mercenaries from the isles are not uncommon. These aspiring warriors seek to prove their mettle in battle, driven by the pursuit of glory and wealth.
