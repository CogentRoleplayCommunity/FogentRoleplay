## Languages

### Babelish

A gift from the Bright Lord to Fellkind after their creation. Seen as the common tongue across most of Terra. Simple and practical, it is used extensively by the common folk.

### Bright-speak

Said to be the language of the Bright Lord and his Brights. A beautiful language that almost sounds like singing. This language is spoken exclusively in the higher echelons of Brightkin society and at the Imperial senate.

### Pirish

A sophisticated language spoken by dhampirs and in upper class society across Reddland. It originates from the Vampires that roamed Terra from before the Bright Lord arrived.

### Deep-speak

Spoken by Sea-folk, sailors, and anyone that does business on or near water. A flowing language, which underwater is much more pleasant to the ear

### Primal

Spoken by Lycans across the Isles of Crest and Leodelphia. A sequence of grunt, snarls, and growls. Words don't really exist in it, as it conveys intention more than specific words. Can be used to roughly communicate with wildlife, though poorly.  No written script.

### Kikishi

Spoken by the Chitinkin (Kiki) and across the Underworld (the giant caverns that stretch beneath the surface of Terra). A series of clicks form the basis of the language.

### Draconic

A very rare and ancient language that has existed since before creation. Since Dragonkin are rare, this language is only used amongst themselves. An almost serpentine like language in sound.

### **Jotun**

Spoken by Giants, Ogres, and Ogrekin.

### Sky-tongue

Spoken by Harpy or Phoenixkin.

### Demonic

Said to be spoken by demons, no record exists of it, only myths.
