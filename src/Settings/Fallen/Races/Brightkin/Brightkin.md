One of the remarkable abilities bestowed upon the Brightkin is their capacity to wield the power of the Bright Lord, known as Miracles. Miracles can creates miracles that transcend the boundaries of natural laws, considering them mere suggestions. To perform Miracles, a Brightkin channels the power of Ichor through intense emotions or vivid memories, harnessing them to achieve their desired effects.

Following their unnatural demise, as long as a Brightkin possesses an internal reserve of light or their lifeless body is exposed to the rejuvenating rays of sunlight, they will gradually resurrect, basked in a resplendent glow. This process restores their body to its peak condition, healing all wounds.
