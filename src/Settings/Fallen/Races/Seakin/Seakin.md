## Distinctive Physical Features

## Culture

Much of Siren culture exists beneath the water, owing to their inherent abilities to breath the water. Siren culture used to dominate much of the eastern part of Terra under the Witch Queen Alana. After her defeat, Siren culture retreated for the most part back to the seas. The largest land-based settlement, Tentcity, lies in the south of what is now modern day Reddland, ruled by House Roseblood.

Sirens worship different gods than the pantheon of the Brights, though they share a god in the Twisting One which they refer to as “The Leviathan”. A prominent deity worshiped is the Moon Presences, the Parent and the Child.
