## Amon & The Mark

Amon was of the first man, and had been given The Mark of Amon by The Creator:

The Mark of Amon is a multifaceted curse. It is by far the strongest curse on Terra as it was made by God.

This curse can be momentarily given to someone else when the bearer willingly give their own blood to someone else. Until the blood is used or destroyed, the original bear is normal. They can die, but will reawaken when their blood is used or destroyed, as they will regain the curse.

Effects of the curses:

1.)

"Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.  When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you."

The Bearer of the Curse has an adverse effect on plant life. This can result in a slow or fast death for said plant. All beings such as druids or worshipers of plant life detest the bearer.

God cursed Amon that he may never reap from the plants of the earth again (Amon’s presence was a pestilence to all plant life around him. When no other parts of the curse are being activated, then it is a relatively small effect zone. Depending on how severely the curse is active, plant life will instantly rot or combust around the Bearer of the Mark in a massive area.)

2.)

"You will be a restless wanderer on the earth."

The bearer has a version of immortality. They will live forever, but can die of old age. However, the bearer will be reborn in a younger version of their body. Their memories of their past life will lie dormant, and will appear in dreams. They also have an insane healing factor, allowing them to never sleep if they don’t want to.

God cursed Amon to be a vagabond & wanderer (outcast) on the earth for all eternity. (The Bearer also has an unlimited healing factor, regenerating from nothing. They will outlive all their family, friends, ect... If the user dies of old age they are made young again, reverting to an earlier stage of their life.)

3.)

"But the Lord said to him, “Not so; anyone who kills Amon will suffer vengeance seven times over.” Then the Lord put a mark on Amon so that no one who found him would kill him."

The bearer has a rebound effect to any intentional harm proportionate to the harm. Cutting with a surgical scalpel during surgery would not activate the effect. This rebound could be physical or physiological. This can be done through random "acts of God" or by the user themselves if they are aware of the curse. If the bearer is killed, the one who killed the user will most surely die or suffer some other emotional blow.

The Mark of Amon was God's promise to offer Amon divine protection, for if anyone tried to harm Amon, vengeance would be taken sevenfold on them. (Any harm done to Amon is brought back on the attacker)

* Blood willingly drawn from the Mark (which appears on the side of the neck) can be given to another desendant of Man. As long as it remains in their body, the Mark's effect is transferred to them.

The Adversary both shared the hate the suffering of existance created by The Creator. Amon became a loyal servant of The Adversary, dubbing him Amon or his "faithful". The Adversary became obsessed with Amon, as they were both outcasts of the Dead God. Over time, The Adversary grew to treasure Amon more than anything else. He gave unto Amon the Spear of Destiny, a weapon that had once injured the Dead God. He also gave Amon an aspect of his power, "Wrath". Amon was made a general of the Legions of Hell, dubbing him the "Demon of the West" for his malice and wrath surpassed even the worst demons of Hell.

## Armageddon

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcQUcZKaLTXjjHZD-4kZsDaCR_kk9ZV5MfGY98Ia59eamp06jLXQs3KRhVVZOuHaxHVTeGGUUZcPLt8lyce5cePVgMQf4-vri45E08LLY5918Mubo4QuvB3DS7G6eyJVW9iLLAiK097ht8qSl6a_GgevtT9?key=za4kZhECor-i8cmOi3oPvA)

When the Rapture occurred on Earth, not all of humanity was brought into the folds of the heavenily afterlife. Those left behind witness the battle between Good and Evil, Armageddon.

During Armageddon, The Legions of The Adversary rallied for the coming battle. Amon remained by The Adversary's side in the final battle, and was pure destruction upon the Dead God's forces. Amon wielded the Spear of Destiny, a weapon capable of slaying Divine beings (Angels, Cherubim, Demons, ect.). Amon's Mark made him virtually unstoppable.

The battles of Armeggedon were so great that tears in the universe's laws were created, which would eventually lead to magic (Fellcraft, Runecraft, Miracles) far into the future. Many divine beings fell to Amon, but in the end, The Dead God was victorious. The Adversary was banished to Earth for eternity along with all of his forces, and when all life had ended, he would be alone, forever. And then the Dead God disappeared from the world.

The leftovers of Humanity, damned to go extinct as the world erupted into chaos, were hunted by the remnant forces of Hell who fed on their consciousness. In the aftermath of Armageddon, Humanity would eventually be brought to complete extinction, aside from Amon. Once what remained of the Earth perished, all that were left was The Adversary, Amon, and the legions of Hell. For an eternity, the world was but a lonely rock.

Tectonic plates shifted, nature grew, the Sun burnt out, and the Earth spun for an infinity. Without the suffering of human conscious's to feed upon, demons began to lose their own consciousness, either feeding on eachother or devolving into monsters, ever searching for life to consume. Demons that were able to resist thought of these monsters as lesser beings...

## On a Dead world, at the end of time, Life begins once again…

The Adversary took his hand at being a creator, though in actuality he could only imitate. He tried to create life of his own, but this never yielded anything but failures and abominations. He settled for copying, using God’s designs to re-create animals, plans, insects, etc… For a time this satisfied The Adversary, though he arrogantly thought to create his own conscious life.

Even though The Adversary could copy every single design aspect of a human, they always ended up as mere husks, devoid of consciousness. For all his intelligence and persistence, The Adversary could not recreate the spark of divinity of the soul. In his desperation, The Adversary planned to use of Amon's rib's for his new creations hopping they would inherient Amon's strength and immortality. While Amon slept, The Adversary reached into Amon and seized a rib. This permanently scarred The Adversary, permanently losing his own rib, nearly shattering him to pieces. With it, like Amon’s father before him, The Adversary copied The Creator’s work, and new conscious life was created, the meek Nascenti.

The Nascenti were a flawed comparted to humanity. The Nascenti's' souls and consciousness were weakly tethered to their physical forms. While they were immortal, they would never grow or develop, suspended in an indefinite stage of adolencence. The Adversary despised his new creations for there flawed nature. Amon grew to love the Nascenti, acting as a father like figure, and offered them assistance and guidance in rebuilding the dead world.

Caring for the Nascenti softened Amon's heart. Amon feared for the salvation of the Nascenti. In the twilight of the world, Amon repented for all he had done. Though Amon was certain that his prayers would not reach The Dead God, while he accepted his damnation, he pray to the Dead God for the Nascenti's salvation. The Adversary, horrified to discover Amon’s repentance, feared that if Amon would be accepted into the Dead God's kingdom, then he would truly be alone, forever on the dead planet.

## The Forging of a new world

The Adversary despised the flawed Nascenti for their weak nature. Their survival depended upon Amon, who took up the role of protector and hunter.

The Adversary searched for a way to duplicate the Mark of Amon onto his new subjects, making them powerful and immortal like Amon. As the Nascenti were of Amon, it was discovered that if Amon willingly took his own blood and shared it with them, they could inherit the Mark of Amon while the blood remained in their bodies. After the blood dissipated in their bodies, the curse would slowly leave them and return to Amon. Amon did not want the Nascenti to have to bear his great burden, and this marked the first time Amon refused The Adversary.

Monster attacks on the Nascenti revealed a dark secret, as result of their imperfect creation the Nascentis could effectively have their consciousness absorbed. If a Nascenti fell to a monster and was devoured, it gained consciousness once again and the humanoid form of the devoured, with no memory. These “Fallen” or Fellkind still maintained many of their monstrous abilities, were far stronger than the Nascentis, and had their consciousness bound to themselves. These were the first Dhampires, Lychans, Sirens, ect…The Adversary took great interest in the Fallen, as they would make far more worthy subjects in his new world. The Nascentis were kind to the Fellkind, as they bore the appearance of their fallen friends and loved ones. It is still unclear if the monster or the Nascenti was the consciousness that remained.

Amon tried to reason with the remaining Demons that had not degraded into monsters to not harm Nascentis. But the Demons had been starving for an eternity. Starved for the malice that maintained their consciousness, they could not restrain themselves. Amon betrayed the Demons in favor of the Nascenti. Some of the strongest Demons that were loyal to The Adversary restraining themselves such as the Princes, but they was the exception. And thus the Demons tried to devour and enslave the Nascentis, to maintain their consciousness. Amon’s wrath was great, and he ripped and tore at the Demons, pushing their forces back to the Hell. He slaughtered many that had called him commander and comrade. To ensure that the Nascentis would have a time to flourish and time to prepare, Amon entered their world. Time moves quicker in Hell, with a second on Terra resulting in an eternity in Hell. Amon raged across Hell for an eternity. When he returned, Amon taught the  Nascentis to fight the Demons like he did, and how to fight the mindless monsters that still breed across the planet. Very few demons remained on Earth, but many monsters still roamed, populating the edges of civilization.

Amon pitied the suffering of the Nascentis as they struggled to find meaning in the Dead World. He also began to teach Nascentis the way of the Dead God, such as forgiveness. The Adversary could not stand for the  "corrupted" teachings of the “Dead God”. Thus Amon left The Adversary to go live a simple life among the Nascentis.

## The Founding of Brightinism

The Adversary was destroyed by Amon's betrayal, his most loyal servant, abandoning him. This was only worsened when the Nascentis rejected him for the way of the Dead God. Filled with malice, The Adversary plotted in secret to unleashing hordes of monsters and set them to devour settlements of Nascenti. If the Nascenti wouldn't worship him, then the Fallen would...

Upon the Fellkin, The Adversary built the Brightinist Church, and became “The Bright Lord” or Bright to the Fallen. In his angelic form, it would be hard to blame them for worshiping him. The Adversary informed them that they were mindless monsters that he had granted consciousness to. They had come from vile Fallen creatures and decreed that they would gain his favor through conquest and innovation. The Adversary passed down his Tenets to his people.

The Adversary was referred to as the Bright Lord.

The newly Fallen were taught “The Tenets of Life” and “The Tenets of Fear”.

### The Tenets of Life:

1: Thou has been given the passion of flesh to spread across the land.

2: Thou shall indulge and consume the world of which I have created.

3: Thou shall seek prosperity in the wealth of the world.

4: Thou shall go without care for the opinions of the world.

5: Thou shall take up arms and seek righteous vengeance upon those that have wronged you.

6: Thou shall recognize the success of one's neighbor, and labor to obtain greatness oneself.

7: Thou are created in the image of greatness, and shall seek strength, knowledge, and greatness to be closer to I, but shall recognize thine greatness is from within thine own labors.

### The Tenets of Fear:

1: Fear the Dead God.

2: Fear the Mark of the Undying. (added later after Amon's betrayal)

The Fallen worshiped their gods. The Adversary then cultivated his new people across the world. The Dead God was to be wiped off the face of Terra, as he had brought about the end of the last world and had abandoned it, leaving it to die. Any who followed his teachings were to be purged from Terra, as their teachings would bring about the end of the world once again.

### The Great Betrayal

The Adversary lured Amon away from the last settlement of Nascenti on Terra with the promise of a pact. The Adversary released monsters upon them as he distracted Amon far away. When Amon returned, those that bore the faces of those he swore to protect attacked him with foul new magic, Fellcraft. Though these beings bore his friends' faces, they attacked him anyway. Amon fled into the wilderness.

The Adversary would only be a corrupting force upon Fellkind. So Amon steeled himself to kill his master and friend. Thus Amon went in search of The Adversary. The Adversary, fearing the wrath of Amon hid himself in the Garden as a serpent, hoping that the Cherubim and The Flaming Sword would hold off Amon as they were from God. Amon proved too powerful, leaving many of the cherubim dead or broken and claiming the Flaming Sword for himself.

When Amon came for The Adversary, their fight was so intense that it split the Garden of Eden from the mainland and severed it from our reality. When they fought, all of Terra shook, the rebound effects of one The Adversary's blows shattered the Moon, creating the Pair (Ursar Major and Usar Minor). And what we know as the Iris sea was formed, from The Adversary falling from the Moons. Amon defeated The Adversary, but could not kill his once friend, and forgave him.

In his pride and wrath The Adversary took up his weapon Adversary and drove it through Amon's heart, cursing the island which they did battle upon to be his prison. The Mark of Amon activated, and for killing Amon, ripping away the aspect of "Wrath". The Adversary was torn apart, and  his 7 pieces of consciousness and soul shattered across Terra, devoid of all memory. His various forms plummeted to Terra.

When the Shards fell to Terra, physical forms coalesced or found purchase within those that claimed them. Those of his worshipers that found their gods bred with them, granting their offspring the Bright Lord's' Heritage.

These offspring were the first Nephalim of this new world, referred to the common people as Brightkin (demi-gods). Brightkin had the power of Miracle's, and as decendants of their gods claimed dominion of Fellkin and the world. The Dawn Empire was formed with the Bright's and their offspring acting as the Imperial family.

Thus began the age of Conquest, and for 10,000 years Fellkin would fight tooth and nail against the monsters of the world for territory on Terra. And in 10,000 the High King Commudus Lightbringer declared the age of Conquest to be over, as thus the age of Illumination began. A time of peace and progress.

### The Order of Amon

The Order of Amon are from the descendants of the members of Fellkind that were slaughtered in The Adversary's Great culling. Amon told these survivors to reject the Great lie, that The Adversary was their savior. When Amon died fighting against The Adversary, the Order worshiped Amon as a martyr. This Order of Amon was warped over time, eventually leading to the worshiping Amon as a god.

From the ancient records of Amon's teachings, they know much of the truth of the world. They believe it is there job to bring about the rapture once again by making contact with the Dead God. To do this they believe they need the carrier of the mark of the Undying. They have searched for the bearer for thousands of years, while also engaged with shadow wars with the Angland's High inquisitors, an order dedicated to their extinction. Through powerful magic the were able to locate the Island were Amon had been banished.

They just happened to bump into the Redguard fleet escorting Flint as he searched for a cure for his daughter. The resulting carnage led to Vex being stranded on the Island. When Vex returned to Redguard, the Order believed that she was the reincarnation of Amon, and the bearer of the mark of the Undying. This is further proven because Vex does exhibit certain abilities of the Curse of the Undying, because she has been drinking Killroy's blood, the true bearer of the Curse.

They seek to reawaken Amon to their true nature. If he will not compile, they will seek their blood in order to use the curse of the Undying to contact the Dead god to reawaken the rapture.

They believe that what they are doing is righteous, and that any sacrifice they make is to dethrone the Great Imitator (The Adversary). One sect of the Order realisied an ancient bio weapon, a hive mind fungus capable of intelligent thought was constructed. This was to sow chaos across the Angland Empire, hoping for an opening to strike.

## The Garden

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfyaGCvp9UyNG-Y59WlEkfovaD6J9G0uuoSn2TUMZ2wkT1LO7nSR3lpcHn_hjycprt7SLnpxv5s18019d7KjdlHt5V5OB7ECugKy6pdIp3EHUzIcRgqaXULnun43qdmswCZQNu-baHspP7apf35NKW9fso?key=za4kZhECor-i8cmOi3oPvA)

Origins of The Garden
After Adam and Eve ate from the Tree of the Knowledge of good and evil, no one was forbade entry. Multiple Cherubim were entrusted with the defense of the Garden of Eden and ordered to guard the Garden of Eden for all eternity for the Tree of Life and Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil still remained at the center of the Garden. A Flaming Sword was also placed there that flew through the air and pointed every way.

The Adversary, fearing the wrath of Amon hid himself in the Garden as a serpent, hoping that the Cherubim and The Flaming Sword would hold off Amon as they were from God. Amon proved too powerful, leaving many of the cherubim dead or broken and claiming the sword for himself. When Amon came to end The Adversary, their fight was so intense that it split the Garden of Eden from the mainland and severed it from our reality. Now existing in a sort of pocket dimension, it randomly appears at different locations at sea.

Temple of Amon (City of Enoch)

The outer edge of the Island is not the Garden, but rather the surrounding area of the Garden. This includes the City of Enoch (The Temple of Amon), which barely peaks out of the ground as it has mainly been buried underground.

The Garden
Animals inside the Garden are peaceful and docile, though on the outside they become animalist once more. The Garden is overflowing with abundance with beautiful fruit hanging from trees. A pacifism effect is induced in all creatures as they feel overwhelmed by the sense of calm that permeates everything.

The Rivers
A river flows into the Garden from where it used to which is now an elevated chunk of land in the west. It flows out of thin air, with the purest water possible.

*Spring of misty water to water the land

* Dusty site where man were Adam was created
