![Copyright](PettyBrightstone.png)



Brightstone is a rare gem that can hold light. The only place it can be found is near Crossroads, where it is said that Bright Lord fell after taking a hit from Amon during the Great Betrayal. The finer and more precisely the gem is cut the more light it can hold.
