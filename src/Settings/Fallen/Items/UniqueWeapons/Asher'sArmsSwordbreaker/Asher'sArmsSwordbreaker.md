A fine swordbreaker purchased from Asherâ€™s Arm, a well regarded establishment in Reddwall known for their grayish blue steel. Swordbreakers were a favorite weapon of Lord Flint Reddington. He commissioned many swordbreakers just like this one for use in dueling.

Swordbreakers, often wielded offhand to a main hand sword. They are designed to catch and bind the opponent's blade, leaving the opponent open for a decisive attack from the main hand weapon.
