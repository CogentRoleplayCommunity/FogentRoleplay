## Currency

Fallen uses coins of Copper, Bronze, Gold, and the ultra rare platinum as currency. Due to silver being deadly to Fellkind and gold not being as abundant on Terra, the currency has been adapted. For simplicity sake we use the DnD 5e commerce system as a reference for prices of goods in our game.

|  Copper Coin  | 1 |  | Mundane |  | 0.02 | 1 cc |
| :-----------: | :-: | :-: | :-----: | :-: | :--: | :--: |
|  Bronze Coin  | 1 |  | Mundane |  | 0.02 | 1 bc |
|   Gold Coin   | 1 |  | Mundane |  | 0.02 | 1 gc |
| Platinum Coin | 1 |  | Mundane |  | 0.02 | 1 pc |

### Conversion between Currency

|  Coin  | Equivalent value |
| :----: | :--------------: |
| 100 cc |       1 bc       |
| 100 bc |       1 gc       |
| 100 gc |       1 pc       |

### Approximate Real World Value

While this is by no means extremely accurate, this gives a rough idea of value that players can use as a reference. This factors in inflation and the scarcity of goods.

| Fallen Coins | US Currency |
| :----------: | :---------: |
|     1 cc     |     $1     |
|     1 bc     |    $100    |
|     1 gc     |   $10,000   |
|     1 pc     | $1,000,000 |

### Out of Game Downtime Bartering Rules

Fallen uses a handy item catalog formatted the same as your characters inventories to make buying, selling, and looting as easy as copying and pasting.

When players arrive in a caravan rest stop, village, or city they may choose to take downtime. The time in the game will pass but the game is not being actively played. During this time player characters may shop at various local businesses.

This system heavily relies on trusting your players to be honest with you about their character's personal finances. If you have players that routinely bend the rules, then these might not be rules you should consider.

## Shop Tiers

The world is a big place, with plenty of small run down villages littering the countryside. While it might be easy to find your character's essential items in large cities, they might not have the same luck out in the wilderness. The following store types describe the various store tiers you will encounter.

**Limited Stock**

A merchant selling wares out of a cart in a bazaar, someone with no brick-and-mortar shop.

**Rural Locale**

A small brick-and-mortar shop in a small town or village.

**Urban Locale**

A brick-and-mortar shop in an average city.

**Premium Locale**

A top tier shop of very large scale found in capitals and large trade cities.

## Shop Prices

Prices vary across regions depending on if there is an excess of good. In war time things might be pricier where as in peace times they are cheaper. Or maybe a group of co
