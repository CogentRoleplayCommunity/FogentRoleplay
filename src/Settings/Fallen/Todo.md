- Be super clear which races start with which Fellcraft
- Figure out cost of upgrading weapons with smithing stones
- Runecraft tattoo stuff and enemies
- Add brotherhood of silver lore

- Write the Beast Of Reddwall
- Black, Redd, White, Jade Court Dhampirs
- Slime fellkin, Slimekin
- rot dragon
- Impkin
- Demon Contracts and Avatars of Brights

- Possibly have the fight between Amon and the Adversary trigger the start of the sun
- Given that it will take 250 million years for the continents to remerge as in the story, the sun has changed a bit.
- The Bright Lord making life on other worlds in the solar system
