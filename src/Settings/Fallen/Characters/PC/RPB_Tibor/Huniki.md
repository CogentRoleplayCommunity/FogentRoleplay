# Annakishi

![Sorry, no art yet to display!]()

## UNFINISHED... Read but don't publish yet!

I had a character idea (for Annakishi) and I've been told to make her Initiate tier, however her story didn't make sense with her royal training and no rebelliousness at Initiate tier. At first I didn't wanna spend extra time meakeing a new character, but reading more and more about Fallen gave me ideas, so I had an idea for a blacksmith advancing to silversmith which does make sense at Initiate tier character.

I made him a hive minded kiki of the same breed as Annakishi to avoid confusing myself if it comes to playing both at any point. :)

***I made up the carapace looking at other armor examples, not sure if it's ok, it will have to be approved... :D (If it's not, Leather armor is the closest equivalent.)***

**Carapace mechanic:**
- Can not be sold or repaired, nor does it count as additional weight, it can only be shed and re-grown using polycraft for 1 ichor and CL2 during rest.
- Shedded carapace can not be reused by others, it becomes brittle in the process. (Otherwise it would be far too easy to armor up the whole team at little cost.)
- Carapace can not be upgraded. (Otherwise a character with natural carapace would not have much incentive to wear other types of armor.)
- Characters born with carapace won't loose it when taking silver damage, as it is their natural form.
- Characters not born with carapace may grow one with polycraft at the cost of 1 ichor at CL3 for 1 day, but they may loose it when taking silver damage depending on their endurance check.
- To differentiate, carapace grown with polycraft may be classified as "Fellkin Armor", while carapace that the character is born with can be "Natural Armor".

## Disposition

- Curious
- Somewhat disagreeable.
- Hive minded.



## Beliefs/Morality

- Loyal to his hive. He wouldn't be adventuring if his hive's queen haven't allowed it.



## Goals/Aspirations

- Find an Order of Silver representative and acquire his own silver plating equipment.
- Get back to his hive.



## Backstory

A silversmith was captured on his hive's territory, and brought to the queen. The queen didn't found him guilty in anything but trasspassing, so she released him with fresh suppliy of food and water provided that he trains one of the hive's blacksmith in silversmithing. Huniki was one of the hive's qurious blackshmiths brave enough to work with silver, and volunteered for this task. He learnt the basics of silversmithing from the captured silversmith, and the silversmith sent him out with his written recomendation to find an Order of Silver representative called Burrowbard Stoneseeker and acquire his own silver plating equipment. Huniki went out with the queen's permission and support.



## Appearance
### Age:
- 24

### Race:
- Kiki (Chitinkin)

### Height:
- 5' 2" (157 cm) ...not counting a pair of foot long antennae waving from the top of her head the top few inches slightly bent.

### Weight:
- ~ 180 lb (82 kg)

### Body:
- Work hardened He has 4 arms sprouting laterally from the top of his torso, the upper 2 arms end in chelae (pinchers) while the lower 2 in human hands covered in carapace from the outside, but soft on the inside. He has natural carapace protecting the outsid of his limbs and torso.
- (No wings for workers)

### Hair:
- Short brown.

### Eyes:
- He has big black compound eyes (multi lens bug eyes), with it's natural advantages and disadvantages.

### Additional Details (Logic behind her appearance only for those who like to read...):
**Bug eye Advantages:**
- Wider then average visual range (180°).
- High sensitivity. (He can see at starlight at night, or distant campfire lit by the enemy he's scouting, or faintly glowing flora in caves, since his kind live in underground hives.)
- Light polarisation (His eyes don't need to adjust to brightness or dimmness.)
- This enables him to react about 5x faster then humans.

(Realistically he should be able to catch an arrow at CL2, or dodge a normal blow at CL1 if challenge level is sized to his species specifically, but assigning a challenge level characteristic to each character's natural features is a bit overkill. No sane GM gonna do that. It's far easier to just size the challange level to human capabilities and spend character attribute points on attributes where the character is above/below human level. That's why I put 1 attribute points into RFX. (I guess that's exactly why every race was granted the birght lord's form, so that challenge level can be sized to humans.)
His kind live most of their lives underground, their vision being complemented by their antennae for tunnel navigation by use of feromones.)

**Bug eye Disadvanages:**
- Unable to see small detail (He can't solve puzzles, can't appreciate intricate detail and never learnt to read, cause he sees regular hand written characters in about 4x4 pixel resolution.)
- He can see a moving humanoid figure far away, he can even see the form raising a weapon to shoot, and react in time, but he can only identify a perspon or object from about 30 foot or closer by sight. (10 meters or closer)

(The closest analog to his vision are low resolution high framerate cameras with fisheye lenses, and automatic IR filter, but no active IR for night vision, just highly sensitive passive IR.
His eyes don't normally glow, he can only see in complete darkness by means of polycraft transformation.)

**Antennae:**
- He has a good sense of smell (having both human nose and antennae), and feromones bugs use to communicate.

**Extra arms and wings:**
- I don't recall ever seeing a genetically 4 legged bug of any kind, kiki should have at least 6 or more limbs, so his kind does, even if he's basically a mix of several different bugs. ;)
Workers of his kind do not have wings, only royals. (Kind like ants.)

**About her appearance in general:**
- He is unlike anyhting I've seen in fantasy. I kinda looked for bugs to combine, and made him unique. Hi eyes come from dragonly. The chelae come from scorpion, the antennae and behavior from ants, and I also gave him some carapace for protection. I made Annakishi first, and they are like ants, so royals have wings, warriors have carapace helmet but no wings, workers have no wings or helmet. Both workers, and warriors should have -1 willpower unlike royals who have 0 and queens who should have +1.
- I didn't look for an existing character class again, Annakishi was my template for him.



## Notes (I'll probably use someting else for character notes... This is far too basic for me.)
### For those who struggle with naming(like I do):
- I picked Hungarian name Huni which is the short for Hunor
- Applied a naming formula eg: {Non-English name} + aki/iki; If {Non-English name} ends in "a" or "i" remove one. (Similar to the other I've done, but he's male so I letf toff the "shi" from the end.)
- His name: Huniki :D
