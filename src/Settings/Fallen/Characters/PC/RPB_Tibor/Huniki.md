***I made up the carapace looking at other armor examples, not sure if it's ok, it will have to be approved... :D (If it's not, Leather armor is the closest equivalent.)***

**Carapace mechanic:**

- Can not be sold or repaired, nor does it count as additional weight, it can only be shed and re-grown using polycraft for 1 ichor and CL2 during rest.
- Shedded carapace can not be reused by others, it becomes brittle in the process. (Otherwise it would be far too easy to armor up the whole team at little cost.)
- Carapace can not be upgraded. (Otherwise a character with natural carapace would not have much incentive to wear other types of armor.)
- Characters born with carapace won't loose it when taking silver damage, as it is their natural form.
- Characters not born with carapace may grow one with polycraft at the cost of 1 ichor at CL3 for 1 day, but they may loose it when taking silver damage depending on their endurance check.
- To differentiate, carapace grown with polycraft may be classified as "Fellkin Armor", while carapace that the character is born with can be "Natural Armor".

## Disposition

- Curious
- Somewhat disagreeable.
- Hive minded.

## Beliefs/Morality

- Loyal to his hive. He wouldn't be adventuring if his hive's queen haven't allowed it.

## Goals/Aspirations

- Help out a friend of the hive called Burrowbard Stoneseeker. (Queen's orders of course. :D)
- Get back to his hive.

## Backstory

Huniki was born in one of the Great Hive cities of Caurus. He was trained from birth to serve his queen and hive as a blacksmith. When the Brotherhood of Silver sent a representative the Hive Queen looking to train a new Silversmith to guard their local region, Huniki was selected for his aptitude and complete loyalty to the Hive.

The Silversmith representative trained and assessed with Huniki for a time, seeing if he had what it took to be a Silversmith. Impressed with his work, the Silversmith sent Huniki to travel across the continent to finish his training at Castle Morne in Reddwall, the headquarters of the Brotherhood of Silver. With the Hive Queens permission and support, Huniki departed for his long journey.

While at Castle Morne, he was required to think independently. This new way of thinking troubled Huniki, as it conflicted with his cultural custom to serve, as he had been instructed what to do his entire life. But the longer he spent away from the Hive, his independent thinking grew. After 4 years of training at Castle Morne, he earned himself the title of Cadet, and departed for Caurus to put his new skill to use.

However, before he could leave Reddland, the Hive Queen reached out with her incredibly powerful mindcraft with a new task. Huniki was to offer his assistance to an elderly molekin named Burrowbard Stoneseeker in Reddwall, who apparently had done a great service to the Hive Queen in the past. He was to treat Burrowbard as his new master, until he was instructed otherwise...

## Appearance

### Age:

- 24

### Race:

- Kiki (Chitinkin)

### Height:

- 5' 2" (157 cm) ...not counting a pair of foot long antennae waving from the top of her head the top few inches slightly bent.

### Weight:

- ~ 180 lb (82 kg)

### Body:

- Work hardened. He has natural carapace protecting the outside of his limbs and torso.
- (No wings for workers)

### Hair:

- Short brown.

### Eyes:

- He has big black compound eyes (multi lens bug eyes), with it's natural advantages and disadvantages. The closest Fogent equivalent is [Darkvision](./../../../../../CoreRules/AdvancedRules/LightAndVision.md).

### Additional Details (Logic behind her appearance only for those who like to read...):

**Bug eye Advantages:**

- Wider then average visual range (180°).
- High sensitivity. (He can see at starlight at night, or distant campfire lit by the enemy he's scouting, or faintly glowing flora in caves, since his kind live in underground hives.)
- Light polarization (His eyes don't need to adjust to brightness or dimness.)
- This enables him to react about 5x faster then humans.

(Realistically he should be able to catch an arrow at CL2, or dodge a normal blow at CL1 if challenge level is sized to his species specifically, but assigning a challenge level characteristic to each character's natural features is a bit overkill. No sane GM gonna do that. It's far easier to just size the challenge level to human capabilities and spend character attribute points on attributes where the character is above/below human level. That's why I put 1 attribute points into RFX. (I guess that's exactly why every race was granted the bright lord's form, so that challenge level can be sized to humans.)
His kind live most of their lives underground, their vision being complemented by their antennae for tunnel navigation by use of pheromones.)

**Bug eye Disadvantages:**

- Unable to see small detail (He can't solve puzzles, can't appreciate intricate detail and never learnt to read, cause he sees regular hand written characters in about 4x4 pixel resolution.)
- He can see a moving humanoid figure far away, he can even see the form raising a weapon to shoot, and react in time, but he can only identify a person or object from about 30 foot or closer by sight. (10 meters or closer)

(The closest analog to his vision are low resolution high framerate cameras with fisheye lenses, and automatic IR filter, but no active IR for night vision, just highly sensitive passive IR.
His eyes don't normally glow, he can only see in complete darkness by means of polycraft transformation.)

**Antennae:**

- He has a good sense of smell (having both human nose and antennae), and pheromones bugs use to communicate.

**About his appearance in general:**

- He is unlike anything I've seen in fantasy. I kinda looked for bugs to combine, and made him unique. His eyes come from dragon-like. The chelae come from scorpion, the antennae and behavior from ants, and I also gave him some carapace for protection. I made Annakishi first, and they are like ants, so royals have wings, warriors have carapace helmet but no wings, workers have no wings or helmet. Both workers, and warriors should have -1 willpower unlike royals who have 0 and queens who should have +1.
- I didn't look for an existing character class again, Annakishi was my template for him.

## Notes (I'll probably use something else for character notes... This is far too basic for me.)

### For those who struggle with naming(like I do):

- I picked Hungarian name Huni which is the short for Hunor
- Applied a naming formula eg: {Non-English name} + aki/iki; If {Non-English name} ends in "a" or "i" remove one. (Similar to the other I've done, but he's male so I left toff the "shi" from the end.)
- His name: Huniki :D
