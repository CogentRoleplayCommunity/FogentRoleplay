## Notes:

## Backstory:

Verd hails from a tribe of Leshenkin and Nature Dragonkin residing in the ancient expanse of the Old Growth Forest located in eastern Reddland. In their role as forest guardians, her tribe ensures that wandering travelers do not meet their demise, for the dragon-infested woods consume all who venture too deeply.

Verd and her younger brother Leif had a wonderful childhood exploring the Ironwoods. One winter, Verd came across a lost group of lumberman, who their tribe had a deal with to remove dead growth from the forest. Verd saved nearly 20 men's lives that day, bravely leading them out of the Dragongrowth. The leader of this group was Burrowbard Stoneseeker, a kindly enterpenually molekin, who took a liking to young Verd, becoming a family friend.

When Verd was 16, Burrowbard, noticing Verd's talent for Naturecraft, offered to sponsor her education at Byrgenwerth University. Her father respected Burrowbard and Verd departed with Burrowbard, living in his estate while she attend school. Verd grew to despise the city as it was full of pickpockets, pollution, charlatans, and drunks. While she excelled in her studies, she missed the simplicity of nature. She missed the wildness of nature, wanting to get out, see the world, and use what she had learned.

Burrowbard, noticing how unhappy Verd offered her an opportunity to be apart of a business opportunity he had recently come upon....
