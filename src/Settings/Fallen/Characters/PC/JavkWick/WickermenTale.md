World Building Lore:

Across Terra, when mothers tuck their children into bed, bandits gather around their campfires, and adventures congregate near the inn’s hearth, the “Tale of the Wicker” is a common tale. A monster/ghost story that has been passed down from generation to generation. The tale of the Wicker is a reminder that the scariest monsters don’t appear to look like monsters at all. “For the Wicker looks just like you and me. Only when it claims your severed head and drags your soul to the bottom of the Abyss will you know you have encountered the Wicker.” For children it is a reminder to not trust strangers or wonder off from your parents. For adults it is a warning that monsters walk among us, and no matter how much power, wealth, or fame you possess, none of it will protect you from true malevolence.

 

As for the actual validity of the Wicker Man, after looking at the supposed historical accounts, there is no definitive evidence. However, while I don’t believe in the “Wicker”, I’m terrified he exists…”– An Narrative Exploration of the Myths of Terra by Volothamp Veddarm

“There is no binding it can’t escape. No trap it can’t evade. No door it can’t open. No price it can be bought for. It is coming for you next. Pleasant dreams.” – Tales of the Wicker

 

Wicker Lore:

 

Stories are usually full of half truths. In reality, there isn’t a “Wicker” or not anymore. Through most of modern time there have been many Wickers, all clones of a human who was believed to be the first Wicker. There have never been more than seven Wickers at any point. There are seven names on rotation, and whenever a new Wicker is created he takes the name of the last one who died. The memories of the Wickers are passed down from Wicker to Wicker. Every Wicker has a “Sponsor”, who acts as a mentor and is responsible for passing down their memories when a new Wicker is created. Within the past 100 years though, the “original” clones have been phased out as the repeated cloning has left them with little to no innate magic.

Long ago, Wickers didn’t kill for only money, but for something approximating a code. But this has all but faded and gold has become the new code they live by, but remnants of the old ways are still respected by every Wicker. The modern Wicker Man organization has close ties to many shady organizations, and the majority of their contracts come from them. Whether its upstart evil wizards, war lords, crime bosses, city officials, or disloyal spies, the Wicker Men always get their mark.

Wicker are highly respected and feared in the criminal underground. Many of the guilds and fences offer tributes and services to the guild. They have access to the best smiths, wizards, and poisoners money and fear can buy. While each Wicker is different, they tend to take pride in the tools of their trade.

Between the Wicker there is a strong brotherhood. They all share the same face, memories, and path. Every Wicker must prove themselves in terms of skill and grit. Each Wicker is born at the biological age of 18, and for the next 3 years works under their Sponsor. This leads to an almost parental relationship between master and student. However, this can sometimes be quite tragic, as rogue Sponsor are often hunted down by their former students.

The calling card of the Wicker Men is their headless victims, a cut so clean that no material weapon could produce. This is an old Wicker weapon enchantment that separated the head from the body of the creature when killed. This is simply for practical purposes, as the head is needed to confirm the contract. But superstitious theories would argue otherwise.

Wicker Men are strong, fast, intelligent, predisposed to extreme violence, and malleable. All Wicker are born with innate magic potential. Wicker Men take up various specialties (classes). While many take up the path of the Rogue, it is not uncommon to see Wizards, Rangers, and others in their ranks. Early on all Wicker are implanted with a shard of darkness deep in their brains, that will grow and eventually kill them. This acts as an expiration date on all Wicker to ensure they don’t get any ideas about leaving the guild or growing into old age. For as they old saying goes “No Wicker leaves the Guild alive”.













 Tale of the Wicker:

The Wicker Man mythos recites a tale of a great and terrible King who loved his only son, the Prince dearly. One day while the Prince was exploring his father's vast kingdom. He approached the dwelling of a seemingly ordinary man, as the Wicker looks no different than you or I. Some tellings of the story say that the Prince killed the Wicker Man's pet and robbed him. Others say that the Prince simply disrespected something that the Wicker held dear. Regardless of the version, the Prince returned to his father the King, and told him what he had done. He lambasted his son, and reached out to the Wicker using his great sorcery, pleading for his son's life in exchange for treasure and privileges beyond counting. The Wicker man simple replied "Step aside. Give me your son."

 The King used every available measure to protect his only son who he loved so dearly. He used his influence to hire great wizards to  contain the Wicker in his home with ancient magic. He sought out great warriors and mercenary companies from across the seas to set deadly traps and ambushes no man could survive all around the capital. He hired the greatest artificers of their time to construct impossible to pick locks and vaults to guard his son, for he loved him dearly. 

But when the Wicker man came, nothing stood in his way. And when he reached the King's son, he took his head like so many others that lay dead. And ss the capital burned, the King far away from the capital once again used his mighty sorcery to contact the Wicker from afar. He raved at the Wicker for taking his son from him, and promised to have his revenge. The Wicker calmly replied, "There are no bindings I can't escape. No trap I can't evade. No door I can't open. I am coming for you next. Pleasant dreams." 

    When the dust had settled and the great King lay headless, the Wicker blended back into the world. So the next time you consider wronging a stranger, remember this tale.  For the Wicker wears a face just like I and you. Only when it claims your severed head and drags your soul to the bottom of the Abyss will you know you have encountered the Wicker. So mind your manners and be kind to strangers or the Wicker may come for you next.

Javk’s Backstory:

Javk’s first memory was being pulled out of the sealed vessel which he was grown in by his Sponsor Vesemir. Javk was the last of the original clones and was the first to be created with no innate magic. In an odd way this was a blessing in disguise for Javk, as it meant his shard of darkness grew much slower than his peers. Javk made up for his lack of magic in sheer violence, ingenuity, body count, and bloodlust in combat. Javk would routinely take the most dangerous contracts, looking to earn respect from his peers, for his pride and wrath were all that defined him.

    As strange as i may seem, it was not the waking hours that Javk feared the most, but those asleep. It’s a terrifying thing to dream with dead men’s memories. He would relive their kills and deaths over and over ever night. Though those dreams actually became the norm, and Javk got use to them. The truly terrifying dreams were those when he was a child. Those of him being innocent, falling in love with a red haired girl, and dying to protect the ones he loved. Javk would wake screaming a balling from these dreams. Jack would never consider these his memories, for that would mean admitting something that would break him. For if these were his memories, and he was capable of love and sacrifice, than maybe he didn’t have to be a monster after all.

Javk continued to carry out his duty. This all change on a botched job were Javk was blown up, mangled, and left to drown in a river. Javk was rescued by Old Ben, a simple human carpenter, tinkerer, and magician. He nursed Javk back to health, though Javk had lost the uses of his left arm and right eye. But Old Ben was more skilled than he would seem at first glance. He constructed Javk a new arm not of flesh and bone, but of enchanted wood, steel, and metal cord. The runes he etched deep in the wood instilled magic in it and brought it to life. He taught Javk how to maintain it and care for it. He even began to work on a magic eye for Javk, though he would never get the chance to finish it.

Ben would travel from town to town performing street magic, fixing peoples wagons, and clocks. Javk initially stuck around to repay his debt, though Ben assured him he owned him nothing. But Javk grew too deeply respect Old Ben. He loved the old man like a father, for he was the first person to believe that Javk had the potential to be something more than a monster. Javk for the first time in his life felt guilt for his sins. Guilt ridden, Javk snuck away from their camp one night, and planned to pierce his heart with his rapier. In his darkest moment Javk stayed his hand. Right there he decided to devote his life to the Good in the world. He spent the next year with Old Ben before he passed. Javk buried his friend and mentor.

 

But this was until Javk was contacted by his old handlers.
