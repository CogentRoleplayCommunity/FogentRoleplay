## Backstory:

Across the world, when mothers tuck their children into bed, bandits gather around their campfires, and adventures congregate near the inn's hearth, the "Tale of the Wicker" is a common tale. A monster/ghost story that has been passed down from generation to generation. The tale of the Wicker is a reminder that the scariest monsters don't look like monsters at all. For the Wicker looks just like you and me. Only when it claims your severed head and drags your soul to the bottom of the Abyss will you know you have encountered the Wicker. For children it is a reminder to not trust strangers or wonder off from your parents. For adults it's a warning that monsters walk among us, and no matter how much power, wealth, or fame you possess, none of it will protect you from true malevolence.

As for the actual validity of the Wicker, after looking at the supposed historical accounts, there is no definitive evidence. However, while I don't believe in the "Wicker", I'm terrified it exists… – An Narrative Exploration of the Wicker Myth by Volothamp Veddarm

"There is no binding it can't escape. No trap it can't evade. No door it can't open. No price it can be bought for. It's coming for you next. Pleasant dreams..." – Tales of the Wicker

Stories are usually full of half truths. In reality there isn't a "Wicker" or not anymore. Through most of modern time there have been many Wicker, all clones of a human who was believed to be the first Wicker. Within the past 100 years though, the "original” clones have been phased out slowly as the repeated cloning has left them with little to no innate magic. The modern Wicker organization has close ties to many shady organizations, and the majority of their contracts come from them. Whether its upstart evil wizards, war lords, crime bosses, city officials, or disloyal spies, the Wicker always gets their mark.

The calling card of the Wicker is their headless victims, a cut so clean that no material weapon could produce. This is an old Wicker enchantment weapon enchantment that separates the head from the body of the creatures when killed with the weapon. This is simply for practical purposes, as the head is needed to confirm the contract. But superstitious theories would argue otherwise.

Wickers are strong, fast, intelligent, predisposed to extreme violence, and malleable. All Wicker are born with innate magic potential. Wicker's take up various specialties (classes). While many take up the path of the Rogue, it’s not uncommon to see Wizards, Rangers, and others in their ranks. Early on all clones are implanted with a shard of darkness that will grow and eventually kill them. This acts as an expiration date on all Wicker Men to ensure none get ideas of leaving.

Javk's first memory was being pulled out of the sealed vessel which he was grown in. Javk was the last of the "original" clones, and was the first to be created with no innate magic. In an odd way this was beneficial for Javk, as it meant his shard grew much slower. Javk made up for his lack of magic in shear violence, ingenuity, body count, and bloodlust in combat. Javk would routinely take the most dangerous contracts, looking to earn respect. This all change on a botched job were Javk was blown up, mangled, and left to drown in a river. Javk was rescued by Old Ben, a simple human carpenter, tinkerer, and magician. He nursed Javk back to health, though Javk had lost the uses of his left arm and right eye. Ben would travel from town to town performing street magic, fixing peoples wagons, and clocks. Javk initially stuck around to repay his debt, though Ben assured him he owned him nothing. But Javk grew to respect Old Ben. Javk for the first time in his life felt guilt for his sins. Guilt ridden with his sins, Javk snuck away from their camp one night, and planned to pierce his heart with his sword. In his darkest moment Javk stayed his hand. Right there he decided to devote his life to the Good in the world. He spent the next year with Old Ben before he passed. Javk buried his friend, and set out into the world ready to make a difference.
