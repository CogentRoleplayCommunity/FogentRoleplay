## Backstory

Destin grew up in a small town outside of Reddwall called Irongrove, a small village on the outskirts of the Oldgrowth Forest, one of the last Ironwood forests on Terra. There, his mother Lilly and father Destin, both mudbloods, carved out their humble life providing blacksmithing services for the local lumber trade. Destin's father handled the forge and his mother handled the books.

Destin was raised to be an apprentice blacksmith. Destin enjoyed learning about smithing, but in truth Destin wanted to be a warrior like his father was in his youth. Always big and strong for his age, Destin took to smithing quickly, almost like the metal wanted to obey him. His father trained him well, not only in Smiting but how to defend himself as he was an officer in the Redd Legion before taking up his humble trade, which Destin loved.

As Destin grew older, he began to realize he wasn't like any of the other kids in the small mudblood community. He was bigger and stronger, and had yellow eyes and small nub horns beneath his hair. He was picked on by the other kids in their small town for being different, but Destin refused to be physically bullied, sometimes taking on multiple bullies at the same time and always winning. During one of these fights, as he was prone to losing his temper, Destin, not knowing his own strength broke a bullies arm. Afterward, Destin's parents sat him down for a serious talk, explaining that he wasn't like the other kids because he was a Dragonkin, and that only his mother was his biological parent. They told him he needed to show restraint when dealing with those weaker than him, even if they were in the in wrong. When Destin pressed for more information, they told him that when he was ready they would explain everything to him, but now wasn't the right time.

His parent's refusal planted the seed of resentment in Destin's heart. When he turned 16 he demanded his parents tell him everything, as he was now a full man. Still believing he was not ready, they denied him again. Enrage and feeling betrayed, that same night Destin ran away from his family home. Deciding he was grown up enough, he took the rusty, charred, and broken greatsword his father had said would be his when he was all grown.

Travelling northward to try and find out more about his past, Destin came across a family and their children on the road being attacked by a shambling Spore infected corpse. A chiding voice in his head told him to intervene instantly, but his own trepedation and fear held him back. Only when the infected lunged towards the child did the voice kick him hard enough to try and help. Because of his hesitation he had to block the lunging creature with his arm, earning him a bite. Quickly dispatching the creature afterwards, he quickly changed course towards Reddwall- now desperately hoping to get in to cure his recently caught infection on Spore.

Getting on a ship that was heading towards Reddwall, Destin was placed alongside other refugees inflicted with the spore, and along the way he met a mudblood named Uhtred Storm and a wraithkin named Trina. Both Uhtred and Destin were inflicted by night terrors, for various reasons, and Trina offered them the substance Mirage to sooth their sleeps. Every so often since then on the boat, Destin has been using the drug, unaware of it's addictive properties.
