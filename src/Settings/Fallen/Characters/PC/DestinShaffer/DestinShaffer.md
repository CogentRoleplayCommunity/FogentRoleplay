Destin grew up in a small town outside of Reddwall called Irongrove, a small village on the outskirts of the Oldgrowth Forest, one of the last Ironwood forests on Terra. There, his mother and father, both mudbloods, carved out their humble life providing blacksmithing services for the local lumber trade. Destin's father handled the forge and his mother handled the books.

Destin was raised to be an apprentice blacksmith. Destin enjoyed learning about smithing, but in truth Destin wanted to be a warrior like his father was in his youth. Always big and strong for his age, Destin took to smithing quickly, almost like the metal wanted to obey Destin. Destin's father trained him well, not only in Smiting but how to defend himself as he was an officer in the Redd Legion before taking up his humble trade, which Destin loved.

As Destin grew older, he began to realize he wasn't like any of the other kids in the small Mudblood community. He was bigger, stronger, he had small nub horns beneath his hair and yellow eyes. He was picked on by the other kids in their small town for being different. Destin refused to be physically bullied, some times taking on multiple bullies at the same time and always winning. During one of these fights, prone to losing his temper, Destin not knowing his own strength broke a bullies arm. Afterward, Destin's parents sat him down for a serious talk, explaining that he wasn't like the other kids and he was actually a Dragonkin child they had adopted from Reddwall. They told him he needed to show restraint when dealing with those weaker than him, even if they were in the wrong. When Destin pressed for more they told him that when was ready they would explain everything to him, but now wasn't the right time.

His parent's refusal planted the seed of resentment in Destin's heart. When he turned 16 he demanded his parents tell him everything is was now a full man. Still believing he was not ready, they denied him again. Enrage and feeling betrayed, one night Destin ran away from his family farm. Destin, deciding he was grown up enough, toke the rusty, charred, and broken greatsword his father had said would be his when he was all grown.

Destin looking for answers headed towards Reddwall, the capital of Reddland. There he happened upon a mudblood teenager about his age getting the snot beat out of him in an alley way by some teenage thugs. Though he tried to walk away, he heard the lessons his parents had drilled into him since birth about defending those that couldn't defend themselves. Destin, cutting quite the scary figure, made short work of the bullies, maybe taking it a tad to far snapping the leader's arm, but he had it coming in Destin's mind. The mudblood's name was Killroy, and Destin offered to escort him home. Upon learning that Destin was a smith, Killroy asked if he could hire him as he was something of an inventor and was trying to start his own business. Destin, needing some way to make money in this new place except his offer, taking up a room in the Weeping Anvil, a small warehouse owned by Killroy in the Diligence District.

Destin worked for Killroy, fabricating metal part for Killroy's various inventions. Around this time Destin began to literally feel the metal as he worked on it, discovering his natural aptitude for Ferracraft. He excelled and Killroy paid him a fair amount. Unfortunately, Destin still feeling a whole in his heart from what he believed to be his parents betrayal, began indulging in Mirage, and exotic drug that would show him what he wanted most. This typically took some fantasy of being with his real biological father, mother, and siblings. In short time Destin was an addict, with the majority of his funds going towards buying more of the addictive substance.
