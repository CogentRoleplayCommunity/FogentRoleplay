## Backstory

Helena Montolie grew up in a loving family in southern Reddland in the region known as Emerald Falls. Her mother, Aurora Montolie was an esteemed astronomer and member of Byrgenwerth University. She would regularly travel back and forth, always bringing home tales of astonishing celestial bodies. Her father, Derick Montolie, worked on the lumber yards. While his wife pursued her academic career, Derick was the perfect stay at home father.

During the height of the spore epidemic, Aurora Montolie returned to the family farm infected. After attacking and infecting Helena, Derick tried to protect his daughter. Unable to kill his wife, the infected Aurora tore his neck out. Helena managed to flee the farm. Later the infected Aurora was put down and the local farm was burned by the Inquisition. Since that day, Helena has never been the same, a cloud of sadness and tear never more than a thought away. She was sent to Reddwall to receive medical treatment to cure the spore.

Helena's memories of her parents:

My parents, Aurora Montolie and Derick Montolie, are the world to me. Mama used to read me a bedtime story every night, even when I became "too old" for stories. She had this wavy blonde hair, and her looked at me as if she was in awe of a planet she discovered. Papa was this big burly man, but his eyes told something else. It showed he'd been through so much, but he's my Papa, and Papa was the strongest man I knew. Papa was the most intimidating person on the block, but once you met him you could tell that he was just a big teddy bear. Maybe not a teddy bear, because if anything threatened me or my mom, he would protect us no matter what. I wish I could've done the same for him.

Mama was returning from a business trip in a neighboring district, so Papa and I decided to make her a "Welcome Back Home" cake. Mama was fascinated with the night sky, so we made the cake star themed. It took an hour to make the cake, and an extra thirty minutes to bake the cake, but we hadn't put on the frosting yet when Mama started knocking on the door. But the knocking was different. It felt aggressive, and sporadic. I started squealing and hopping in place. "Papa, we haven't finished the cake yet, what are we going to do?"

"Calm down Lena. Plans sometimes don't go the way you want them too, and sometimes you need to adapt to the situation. So how about I stay and apply the frosting to the cake, and you answer the door and distract your Mama. Is that a plan?" Unlike Mama, Papa always knew what to say and when to say it. His tone was calm and composed. I imagine Papa's voice is like rain falling in a forest, hitting the leaves and on it's way down to the dirt ground.

"You got it Papa!" I started heading towards the door. The sporadic knocking turned into banging. I thought to myself, "She probably had a bad day at work, I bet being at home will cheer her up." I unlocked the door, and as I opened it her body came tumbling inward, crashing into the ground beneath her. She lifted her head, and looked at me. Her skin was grey, her eyes burnt out and turned dull, and she had a gash in her neck with no blood squirting out. In rapid succession, Mama grabbed my hand and sunk her teeth into my wrist. Blood rushed out of my wound, and decorated her face.

"PAPA! HELP!" Papa, knife in hand, rushed out of the kitchen to witness the love of his life gnawing on the arm of his child. Papa turned into a deer in headlights, he didn't know what to do. This was the first and last time I witnessed fear engulf him. Papa ran towards Mama and tackled her onto the ground. "Aura, what is wrong with you!" Papa stared into her eyes, and found nothing but a vast void. She wriggled out of Papa's grasp, and sunk her teeth into Papa's neck. Papa couldn't stab the woman he loved, so he let it happen. It was first the neck, then the face, then she tore open his stomach. I stared at the mangled body of Papa in front of me. I couldn't move, I couldn't help Papa, and I couldn't help Mama.
