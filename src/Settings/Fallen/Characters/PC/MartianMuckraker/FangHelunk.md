## Backstory

When Fang was merely a babe, both his parents were imprisoned by the Inquisition of The Dawn Empire for heretical worship as members of the Cult of Amon. Burrowbard Stoneseeker, an elderly molekin business man and close family friend took Fang in. Worried that the Inquisition would seek out young Fang for his parents sins, Burrowbard arranged for Fang to live among the Ogrekin tribes that lived in the foothills of Reddland, far from civilization, until it was safe for him to return.

Fang grew up wild, tough, and with a tribe that grew to become his family. Burrowbard had make it a point to visit Fang every year to check in on him. When Fang was older, Burrowbard layed out what had happened to his parents. Fang was originally shocked to learn of his origin, and pleaded with Burrowbard to take him back so he could learn of his biological parents fate. Burrowbard warned Fang that he might not like what he found, but obliged. Burrowbard help Fang get his footing in Reddwall. It didn't take Fang long to find that his parents had been executed shortly after their imprisonment. The horrible truth changed Fang deeply, and though he wasn't capable of avenging his parents, he could begin fighting back against the injustice he saw plaguing the good people of the city he had come to know as his second home.

By day Fang worked for Burrowbard, guarding Ironwood warehouses. By night, Fang acted as a vigilant, stealing from crime lords, thugs, and charlatans alike giving the stolen goods back to the victims, along with providing anonymous tips to the authorities.
