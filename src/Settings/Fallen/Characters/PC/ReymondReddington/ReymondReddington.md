His father denied his request to work in the family business, noting his lack of direction. Reymond, taking initiative reached out to his mother's old friend Burrowbard Stoneseeker who he had know since a childhood. Burrow took Reymond under his wing, teaching him the business and fostering Reymond innate business savvy. Reymond took his inheritance and began starting business ventures with Burrowbard in the ironwood trade. Reymond fell in love with commercial ventures, and bringing something of value to the world.
