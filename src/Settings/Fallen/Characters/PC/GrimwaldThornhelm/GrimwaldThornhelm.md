## Backstory

Grimwald is a hedge knight. He is a youthful 24. He is bold, cunning, and accurate. He is superstitious about all things related to magic, ghost, and the super natural. Made freaks him out as it is beyond the scope of the world he is use to, combat. As a mercenary for hire, Grimwald travels were ever the coin leads.

Grimwald was orphaned after a group of monsters attacked his small family farm. Still young, Grimwald was unable to protect his family, a bitter regret he holds to this day.
