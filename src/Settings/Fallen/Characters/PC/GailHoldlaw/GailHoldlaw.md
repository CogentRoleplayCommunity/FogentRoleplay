When holding the staff, you can use your action to cast one of the following spells from it, provided you have a vocation that can unlock the magic required for these spells: Physical Protection (1 charge) or Mage Shield (2 charges). No components are necessary. At the break of dawn, the staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges. Should the staff exhaust its charges entirely, roll a d20. If the result is 1, the staff shatters and meets its destruction. | While Equipped |                    4 Charges                    |

## Backstory

Gail Holdlaw of the Holdlaw family is many things. A brilliant student, a skilled speaker, a man of status, a son of a Magistrate. But there is one thing he is not. An adventurer.

Born to the Holdlaw family, Gail lived in the lap of luxury during his upbringing. His family line, once teeming with the fellblood of Harpy descended from the great frost rocs of the spine of the world, now diluted enough to be mere mudbloods, still held great power and import, his father being the magistrate of the town of Emerald Falls and the only male offspring he had, Gail was groomed at an early age to be his business partner and eventual successor, and was sent to attend the prestigious Byrgenwerth Academy to forwards that goal. During his time at the academy, he excelled in most fields with a natural keenness and curiosity, but one in particular always caught his eye, Runesmithing. The precision needed for each rune, the incredible effects it could produce, the subtle details and movements evolving into power and grandiosity of such scale- in it he saw something. A chance to recapture the respect and prestige his family once had when their blood was still strong, to show up those that called his father a 'pawn' of other more noble powers. And as such, he set his sight on mastering the art.

Then came a dreadful day and a dreadful letter. His father's handwriting telling him that he would no longer be able to attend the Academy any longer, that funds were low and none could be moved around to make ends meet. He would have to return home and continue his studies in a more practical sense, working alongside his father. To Gail, who had been putting his entire effort into his studies and advancement, found this unacceptable. With the money he still had and the knowledge he possessed, he decided that he would strike out on his own, to find his own glory on his own terms. However- 'adventuring' in the romantic sense turned out to be quite costly, and he soon found himself lacking for funds. Though reluctant to do so, he contacted an old friend of his father, Burrowbard Stoneseeker, asking for support. Instead of monetary support, he was given a job, which would pay upon completion. With little other options, in spite of his haughtiness, he agreed to this task.
