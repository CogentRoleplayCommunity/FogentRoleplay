## Backstory

After waking up with only amnesia and the clothes on his back (which bore the number 16 draw in red paint on the back), 16 headed for Reddwall, the sprawling Gothic Capital of Reddland. There he searched for clues about his past, but none surfaced. In order to feed himself, 16 took up odd jobs acting as protection or muscle for various employers 16's work spoke for itself, quickly earning him a reputation as a reliable merc.

This caught the attention of Burrowbard Stoneseeker, a local Molekin business man. Over drinks, Burrowbard learned of 16's unknown past and offered his assitance to 16, giving him access to his wide network of contacts free of charge. 16, greatful to his new friend and unwilling to take a hand out, offered to exchange his services guarding Burrowbard's valuable Ironwood caravan in exchange for using his network. Both men happily agreed, and thus a friendship/business relationship was born. 16 now spends half his time as a mercenary and the other half searching for who he is...
