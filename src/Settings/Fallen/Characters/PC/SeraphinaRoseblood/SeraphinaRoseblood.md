## Backstory

Seraphina, a lower member of House Roseblood, carries the weight of her noble lineage with a seriousness that belies her tender age. Beneath her composed exterior, however, beats a heart brimming with compassion and empathy for those she holds dear. Life has dealt her family a cruel hand, for her devoted father, the pillar of their household, is beset by an unfortunate sickness that has rendered him bedridden.

In the face of adversity, Seraphina rises to the occasion, taking it upon herself to shoulder the burden of their crumbling family estate. Guided by her innate talent for Hydrocraft, she ventures into the perilous realm of mercenary work to secure their financial stability. Her every step, while motivated by love and duty, carries with it the weight of her father's concern, as he worries profusely about the risks she undertakes.

Amidst her unwavering determination to preserve their fading reality, Seraphina finds solace in memories of her older brother. Though he chose to leave their family behind in pursuit of worldly adventures, his absence lingers as a bittersweet reminder of their shared past. Nevertheless, she forges her own path, fueled by the desire to honor her father's legacy and provide him with the comfort he deserves.
