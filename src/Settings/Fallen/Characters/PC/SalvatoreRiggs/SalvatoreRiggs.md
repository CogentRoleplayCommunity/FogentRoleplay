## Backstory:

Salvatore Riggs spent his formative years navigating the gritty streets of Reddwall, raised in a lower-class family that instilled in him the importance of financial acumen. Early on, he grasped the imperative nature of money, initiating his journey by deftly picking pockets and peddling pilfered wares on the clandestine market. By the age of 18, Salvatore had evolved his endeavors into overseeing a modest fencing operation.

While Salvatore did not shy away from hands-on work, he distinguished himself through the finesse of his words. His reputation in the community burgeoned due to his unwavering loyalty and dedication to his associates. Salvatore's pivotal moment materialized when Burrowbard Stoneseeker, a highly regarded business figure in Reddwall, extended an invitation for collaboration.

Burrowbard sought a partner to co-manage the intricate logistics of importing and exporting rare antiquities in and out of Reddwall. Leveraging Salvatore's skills and Burrowbard's influential connections within the city government, a prosperous alliance was forged—marked by operational success, mutual partnership, and the blossoming of a genuine friendship.

The enterprise flourished seamlessly in the ensuing years. As the business prospered, Burrowbard approached Salvatore with yet another entrepreneurial venture he was fervently developing.
