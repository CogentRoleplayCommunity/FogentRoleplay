## Backstory:

Vasilii Anatoli, the seventh son of a seventh, was born to a noble family in the Empire. His father Baron Vlad Anatoli had many serfdom and properties across the Empire. He was a hard yet fair ruler. This had more to do with his wife Baroness Anna who he loved dearly.

Vasilii grew up with a silver spoon in his mouth, as did all of his seven brothers. While Vasilii's brother behaved more like their father's hard and cold demeanor, Vasilii instead took after his mother's kindness and warmth. Vasilii's mother loved all of her children, but she loved Vasilii most of all.

Vasilii's brother would torment him relentlessly, as Vasilii loved speaking and befriending common folk. But Vasilii was strong for his age and would give as good as he got. Most of these scuffles ended when his brother Artyom, the second oldest, would break up the fights. Vasilii loved Artyom as he always looked out for him.

By far the best part of Vasilii's childhood were the bedtime stories his mother would read to him. She loved the scary stories, the ones that always ended with a stern warning. But Vasilii's favorite were the ones about heroes battling monsters and saving fair maidens. She'd tuck Vasilii in every night with his red blanket, kiss him on the head, and tell him "I love you stronger than iron and softer than feathers my little boy."

But everything changed that cold winter morning. Vasilii was only ten, when that man had stepped out of the crowd. Vasilii had never quite seen what it was that he was holding, as he usually sat at the back of the carriage he and his brother rode in. It all happened so quickly, the man tossing an odd device into the carriage in front of Vasilii. The one his mother and father usually rode in. The blast had left Vasilii's ears ringing. His mother had been traveling alone that day. The funeral was held three days later.

A portion of his father's serfs attempted an uprising. But they were slaughtered quickly by his father’s soldiers and wizards. His father became cruel and unreasonable after his wife’s death. After he had killed all the revolutionaries, he enforced harder taxes and restrictions on all under his rule as to him they were not different from those who had taken his wife.

When Vasilii was 23 his father had sent him, Artoym, and Borya his oldest brother to remove a thief's hand. A mother had stolen grain out of the Barons stores to feed her infant. Boyra, the cruelest of his brothers, had instead staged a public execution for the woman in the town square. Vasilii, who had become the advocate of the common folk  to his father, attempted to do the same to his brother. But Borya was out for blood. In the name of the Good, before his brother could bring his sword down, Vasilii drove his sword through his brother's heart.

The whole incident was covered up, and his brother's death was blamed on a cell of revolutionists. Artoym pointed out that the people would rise up if Vasilii was executed. Instead his father banished him, never to return.

Vasilii took up the cause of the people, traveling wherever he heard the common folk in need. He became vengeance for those who didn't have the strength to fight for themselves. It was during one of these quests that he crossed path with Burrowbard Stoneseeker, a fellow lover of justice for the common people. They bonded over long night of drunken exploits, with Vasilii genuinely being surprised that he found someone that could out drink him. Burrowbard began funding his exploits as his patron and Vasilii grew into something of a folk hero in the region surrounding Reddwall known as "The Bear Knight".
