## Backstory

In the quiet town of Tuntin, nestled between rolling hills and lush green meadows, there lived a peculiar mule named Gus. Despite his unassuming appearance, Gus was no ordinary mule. At the age of 15, he had become a legendary character in the hearts of the townsfolk, known for his brown fur, sassy attitude, and a certain penchant for unleashing unexpected bursts of gas at the most inappropriate moments.

Gus was born on a quaint farm owned by the Eastwood family, who quickly realized they had a unique and spirited companion in their midst. As a young mule, Gus exhibited an independent and sassy demeanor that set him apart from the other farm animals. His brown fur shimmered under the warm sunlight, earning him the affectionate nickname "Golden Gus" from the children of Tuntin.

From a young age, Gus seemed to have a knack for mischief. He would often playfully kick up his heels, sending dust clouds swirling through the air, and he developed a reputation for being the most stubborn mule in town. Yet, it was his unexpected flatulence that truly made him a legend. No social event or town gathering was complete without a memorable toot from Gus, much to the simultaneous amusement and chagrin of the townsfolk.

Despite his sassy nature, Gus was an indispensable member of the Eastwood farm. His strength and resilience made him the go-to mule for heavy-duty tasks, whether it be plowing fields or hauling supplies. The Eastwoods, although exasperated at times, couldn't help but love their unconventional companion.

As the years passed, Gus became a symbol of the town's resilience and humor in the face of life's challenges. He was not just a mule; he was a beloved character woven into the fabric of Tuntin. Children would gather around him, listening to tales of his escapades with wide-eyed wonder, and adults would share a knowing smile whenever his name was mentioned.

One day, a local artist even immortalized Gus in a mural on the side of the general store, capturing his sassy expression and golden brown fur for all to see. The mural became a cherished landmark, attracting visitors from neighboring towns who wanted to catch a glimpse of the famous Gus.

As Gus continued to age, his mischievous spirit never waned. He became a living legend, a symbol of the enduring charm found in unexpected places. The town of Tuntin, with its rolling hills and green meadows, owed much of its unique character to the one and only Gus the Mule – the sassy, gassy, and utterly unforgettable icon of their close-knit community.

After the murder of his master's at the hands of the Lavendar Lancers, Gus the Mule now travels with Swordpoint, a rag-tag band of deputies/merc, all in search of those responsible circumstances that lead to his families death.
