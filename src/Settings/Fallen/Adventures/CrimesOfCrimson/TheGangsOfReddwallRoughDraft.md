# Act 1 - Setup (25%)

## Exposition

The two gangs of Reddwall are both looking to heist a large warehouse Healing blood as it is insanely valuable. They both intend to steal it and sell it on the black market to the highest bidders.

## Inciting Incident

As the new comers to the Weeping Anvil workhouse, the gang sees them as key parts of their plans to scope out the warehouse (sealed crates they never see, which on the night of the heist will be healing blood) and let in their members. They will both approach the party asking/threatening scout out the building, map guard movements, obtain guard documents about incoming shipments.

## Plot Point 1

After the party obtains these pieces of information, which ever gang they didn't side with becomes hostile and begins sending low level thugs to rough them up and get the information.

## Act 2 - Confrontation (50%)

## Rising Action

The adversarial gang puts out a city wide hit on the party.

The moral implications of how this will effect the poor and downtrodden who rely on the charity of house Reddington becomes apparent. Maybe a scene where they help distribute some of the healing blood. Also, the stock pile of healing blood is shipped away meaning that the theft of this healing blood could lead to people's death's.

The party has to choose whether to allow the heist to happen or to go the guards or Killroy to spring a sting operation on the criminals. This has to be kept to a small amount of guards as it is believe some within the guard are on the take.

## Midpoint

A fire or other distraction is set to allow the guard presence to be limited at the anvil.

The heist and/or sting goes off.

## Plot Point 2

Twist: The enemy gang show their hand and tries to swoop in to steal the take in full force.

Also, Uhtred should probably be killed here so he can resurrect as a brightkin.

# Act 3 - Resolution (25%)

## Pre-Climax

The characters are trapped within the weeping anvil and the other gang come out in force to slaughter not only the party but all they hold dear (the other people in the orphanage), planning to burn it with them alive.

## Climax

Massive fight to defend the anvil.

## Denouement

If the character's side with the guards, they heroically take down both gangs and capture both of their leadership.
