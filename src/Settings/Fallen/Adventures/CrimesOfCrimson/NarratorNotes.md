* [ ] "It has been in the family for a bit, passed down from father to son. It'll be yours one day junior. Who knows, you might need it someday."
* [ ] "Oh, don't give me that look. It might not look like much now, but the one of the tricks of life. See Destin, there are two kind of people in the world, one of my good friend for my soldiering days taught me this. See, Type 1 looks at this sword for what it is. They see a beaten down piece of steel, flawed, ruined, not worth the effort... Type 2 asks a simple question, "what if", what if I reset the edge, what if I retempered the blade, what if I rewrapped the handle..., what if I could make it better...". I hope that you have picked up that we aren't just talking about swords... Your mother and I are so proud of the young man you've become, strong in both mind and body. I know them boys been rilling you up, but whooping them sensless isn't solving anything. What if you were the bigger, what if you extended an olive branch, what if you turned them into friends instead of adversaries, a boy your age should have friends his own age"
* [ ] Have Destin's gear chest and sword wrapped in a rug delivered.

  * [ ] She will ask Destion about his past in Irongrove. She will mention that she knew Destin's father and intends to send for them to retrieve there son after his is cured of the infection.
  * [ ] She warns both of them that the gang violence is esculating and she aspects them to be reached out to soon for recruitment. She begs them not to get involved as she has had to bury too many adolencents in the recent months who have gotten caught up in the gang war.
  * [ ] She knows that they were the source of the tip that lead to the bust last night in Yellowbelly. She advises the party to keep their heads down as if this info got out the Burrowers would certainly seek revenge. She also suspects their might be a rat within the guard leeking info so this might be more likely than they'd assume.
