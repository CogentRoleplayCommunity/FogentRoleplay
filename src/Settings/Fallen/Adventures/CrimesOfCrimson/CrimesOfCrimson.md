### World Info

"In the infinite void of space lies a seemingly unimportant galaxy...

And in that galaxy, lies a peculiar star. The star's peculiar cycle initiates its celestial journey with a gentle warmth, casting a luminous yellowish light. As the cycle progresses, the Sun transitions into captivating shades of orange and red, illuminating the planets that orbit it with an enchanting radiance. Gradually throughout it's cycle, it grows in size, commanding a more prominent precense as seen from that planets below. At the culmination of its cycle, a magnificent burst of radiant white light emanates, drawing the star back together and restoring its initial warm yellow hue.

And orbiting this peculiar star, third in the solar systems orbit, lies a seemingly unimportant planet, known by it's inhabitants as Terra.

And on this planet lies a sprawling continent, known as simply as "The Continent", its colossal size dominating a large portion of the planet. It's inhabitants mainly consist of a spieces known as "The Fallen" or Fellkin, a humanoid race with varying degrees of monstrous features and biological abilities. Though the vast majority of the Continents population, they are led by the Brightkin, descendants of the brights or gods.

And on the eastern edge of "The Continent", lies the country of Reddland ruled by the ancient and noble house Reddington, ruled by Lady Veronica Reddington and her bond Lord Flint "The Laughing Storm" Reddington. A dhampir nation, it's inhabitants are known as great scholars, warriors, and merchants. In recent times, their invention and control of "The Healing Blood", a panacea and the only know cure for the victums of the Spore infection that ravages the planet, has made Reddland one of the wealthiest and most powerful kingdoms on the planet.

And on the eastern edge of Reddland, bordering the Siren Sea, lies it's capital, Reddwall, Given its name for the massive red granite wall that surrounds it. Sitting atop the ruins of the previous capital of the Witch Queen Alana, Reddwall is littered with gothic superstructures made of varying colors of granite. Furthest from Castle Tearstone, the prominent deep red granite Castle of house Reddington, structures are relatively small in size, made of less desirable granite colors such as pale yellow or gray. As the construction nears Castle Tearstone, structures become larger in scale, shades of yellow granite transition to orange, then almost exclusively red as Tearstone is approached. Among the many marvels of Reddwall, Byrgenwerth school of magic and medicines stands as one of the prominent staples of the city, responsible for the creation of the Healing Bloods of Reddwall under the brilliant Lady Veronica Reddington. As a member of the Dawn Empire, Reddwall has opened her gates to any seeking the life saving medical treatment only they can provide.

And in the city sits the Docks of Reddwall, bordering "Beached Bay", it's pure unsalted waters as clear glass said to be a result of ancient magic of the Witch Queen Alana and her ancient Siren kingdom which Reddland now occupies

And just pulling into it's designated dock is a small merchant vessel known as the "Wind's Pride". Though normally it's cargo would consist of the silver's of Uskal, the drug Mirage of the great emptiness, or the iron wood lumber of Old Growth Forest, today it is contracted by the Dawn Empire to carry diseased refugees, seeking the Healing Bloods of Reddwall.

And taking in Reddwall for their first time, leaning against the railing stand two seemingly unimportant adolescences..."

### The Docks

- Both character have a mirage addiction, first given to them by Trina, an white haired wraithkin teenage girl who worships the Bound One. She has gray eyes, bags under her eyes, and wearers a light purple scarf. She is actually a member of the Lavender Lancer's, a gang controlling the black market around the Mirage trade. They are currently at war the Burrowers or the Stoneseeker Mafia. Train rides these ships into town to recruit promising gang members and get refuges addicted to mirage. She sets up a meeting with them in yellow belly to hook them up with some work and mirage.
- Upon arriving at he docks, they are sorted into the youth section.
- Asked for their papers.
- They are quickly given their first treatment of healing blood an Dhampir Nurse named Joy.
- While they are receiving a blood transfusion, one of the refugees dead on the ships springs to life. It leaps from the vessel into a crowd of people. Near the players, a Imperial Inquisitor raises his hand summoning the miracle of fire as a massive ball. Before he can lose a woman clad in red plate steps forward her hand out stretched, her eyes focused on the monster. Her eyes flash as she thrust her hand forward, as deep red spear of glistening blood erupts from her hand. As it impales the creature, it disappear into the creature, before the woman rips her extended hand back, it heart exploding from its chest. The crowd stands in shocked silence, the woman eyeing the inquisitor with dangerous glowing eyes before the fire in the inquisitors hand fade. She orders here men to dispose of the body and the lines to resume in and orderly fashion, which they do.
- After their infusion, they are assigned to a building in the Diligence district know as the Weeping Anvil.
- "You walk thought the crowded city streets."

### The Weapon Anvil

- Upon arriving at the Weeping Anvil, you can see what appears to be some kine of conflict... 3 burrower adolescent thugs, part of the Burrowers gang, that are trying to get a young beastkin teen to join there gang. They don't seem to be taking no for an answer.
- The fight ensues, but ends when Killroy and Sherwood returns with Killroy. The thugs are scared of Sherwood as she is know to be quite the badass.
- Killroy welcomes the party to the anvil. He will explain anything they want to know about Reddwall, including the gang war between the Lavender Lancers and the Burrowers. He also show them to where they can set their stuff.
- When Ron and Tom arrive, they'll process the party. Talking to them about their back story.
- The Burrowers are trying to recruit/intimidate some of the residence of the Weeping Anvil to join their gang

The two gangs of Reddwall are both looking to heist a large warehouse Healing blood as it is insanely valuable. They both intend to steal it and sell it on the black market to the highest bidders.

## Inciting Incident

### The Weeping Anvil

As the new comers to the Weeping Anvil workhouse, the gang sees them as key parts of their plans to scope out the warehouse (sealed crates they never see, which on the night of the heist will be healing blood) and let in their members. They will both approach the party asking/threatening scout out the building, map guard movements, obtain guard documents about incoming shipments.

leverage mirage addiction to force them to do what they want

## Plot Point 1

After the party obtains these pieces of information, which ever gang they didn't side with becomes hostile and begins sending low level thugs to rough them up and get the information.

## Act 2 - Confrontation (50%)

## Rising Action

The adversarial gang puts out a city wide hit on the party.

The moral implications of how this will effect the poor and downtrodden who rely on the charity of house Reddington becomes apparent. Maybe a scene where they help distribute some of the healing blood. Also, the stock pile of healing blood is shipped away meaning that the theft of this healing blood could lead to people's death's.

The party has to choose whether to allow the heist to happen or to go the guards or Killroy to spring a sting operation on the criminals. This has to be kept to a small amount of guards as it is believe some within the guard are on the take.

## Midpoint

A fire or other distraction is set to allow the guard presence to be limited at the anvil.

The heist and/or sting goes off.

## Plot Point 2

Twist: The enemy gang show their hand and tries to swoop in to steal the take in full force.

Also, Uhtred should probably be killed here so he can resurrect as a brightkin.

# Act 3 - Resolution (25%)

## Pre-Climax

The characters are trapped within the weeping anvil and the other gang come out in force to slaughter not only the party but all they hold dear (the other people in the orphanage), planning to burn it with them alive.

## Denouement

If the character's side with the guards, they heroically take down both gangs and capture both of their leadership.
