- When the party meets her, trying to talk to dead lancer. Intruded by the banshee
- Wants the Lancers gone

## Ideas

- Arinoth dad is old Arinoth, hence why he was mistaken for his father and why his father's spirit is interacting with him.
- Blackspider kills a lancer spies and offers to trade with the party
- Glassmith has runecrafted his flesh to glass
- The Townmaster is going to change his mind about Killing the lancer's, instead he wants the party to turn themselves over to them so the town isn't destroyed.
- Play upon character's disablings

## Redbrand Hideout session

The session will start with the player's gearing up to go take on the Lavender Lancer hideout.

Ulfric will find the party and encourage them to removed the Lancer threat from the good people of Tuntin. Ulfric will reveal that he joined this job partially to help Burrowbard, but also to search for his friend Sylas Alabaster. As young men, Sylas, Burrowbard, and Ulfric were adventures. Ulfric speculates that the Lancers must have imprisoned or killed Sylas along with the town sheriff who has gone missing as his dear old friend would never put up with this lawless chaos.

As they gear up, a Lancer spy will be spying on them about to leave to inform Glassmith of this new party who's killed his men. The Black Spider, disguised, will slit the spies throat. She introduces herself as Nezzarna. She imply she has been keeping an eye on the party since they've entered town and her employer is aware that the party has the puzzle box in their possession. Her employer wants to trade the party for it. She wants to trade for the puzzle box as she "I wanted to purpose a trade for something in your possession, and if it were to fall into the Lancer's possession, well, they are not the most honorable business partners". She will offer them anything for the puzzle box "I am very well connected in the area, I could arrange for you to have almost anything or anyone delivered to you...". Why does she want the puzzle box "I think our reasons are very much the same".

She let's the party know that she will have a letter delivered to them about where they can come and negotiate in the coming days.

## Session 5

- Have Vasilii enter via the cellar door. He was in town to help his friend Sherif Clint, who had needed extra muscle for the Lancer threat. Vasilii and Clint were double crossed by the town master, who slipped sedatives into their drinks. They buried Vasilii alive and buck naked out in the woods, though not deep enough, as Vasilii managed to survive the ordeal, his body hibernating via his polycraft. Vasilii wants revenge on the town master, to save his friend Clint, and to take down the Lancer threat.

## Session 6

- Arinoth and Skuath start the session completely mind fucked. Skuath is having a vision of Reddwall on fire. Arinoth is having a vision his jungle home on fire...
- Session start with the party heading back to Tuntin as the town masters building is burning
- Glassmith has abducted the town master and fled to the outskirts of Tuntin.
- Gail hands over the Spider Web Pact note to Ulfric Warwinter.
- Ulfric tasks the team with finding his friends Sylas, who he said has gone rogue and is using the name Glassmith. They couldn't have gotten far...
- Krater decide to stay with decides to stay with the family and town incase Glassmith comes back.

## Session 7

- Gail has finished his initial exemenation of Glassmith's study. He has realized this would be a fine place to set up shop for him to create potion, scrolls, or other tasks that take a good workspace. Gail's grew up in his father's stronghold, recognizing that if Rozen manar could make a fine base of opperations for the ensuing quest. However, the creature still remains, which poses both a threat to anyone who would inhabit Rozen manor, but also the nearby, sheriffless, and for all purposes defenseless town of Tuntin. Gail has begun to return to town looking for the others and not wanting to stay in alone for too long.
- Vasilii your keen sense of smell eventually leads you to the camp minutes after the fight between Arinoth, Skuath, and Malgon. You hears a rustling from a nearby tent, which contains the hog tied Town Master, who had betrayed you and Sheriff Clint, drugging you and handing them over to Glassmith and the Lancer's. You hear a omonous yet familar noise and you turn around to see a greatsword driven into the ground. It bears a bone pommel in the style Bears head with a fine leather grip. As whispers enter your ears, images of Sherrif Clint's dead body, orphaned daughter and widowed wife flash through your mind, and you feel the monster within you stir, hate, vengence, and your need to punish evil fills your heart.
- Then you are standing over the Town Mayor, the sword in your hands, feral blood lust in ever fiber of your being. Then, some where, deep in the back of your mind, you remeber grasping the hand of your friend, your captian, and though you'd never say it explicitly as that would only be for soft men like Gail, your brother. Blood trickling from both of your hands, speaking an oath to one another, "To change, to be more than monsters, to be better men...".
- You know that this man should stand trial, to answer to the people that he has harmed, not just you... but maaaaaaan would it feel good tear him limb from limb, right here, right now...
- The last words of the oath coming off your lips "..., there is always a choice."
- Gail, you run into town, the fire on the town masters house completely out of control. The fire is getting outt of hand, threatening the nearby buildings. The town people look exhuasted, and the only one still going strong appears to be your companion Krater, furiously sprinting giant buckets of water from the town well.
- Arinoth, Skuath, and Malgon return to town with Glassmith in tow as the fire is put out. The town people, cheer as the leader of the men who has oppresed them for months is finally brought to justice. In the crowd of people, Linette, covered in wet ash and smoke gives Arinoth a passionate kiss, before playfully pulling away, slowly bating her and saying "later..." before letting stepping back into the crowd of cheering towns people.
- Vasilii will return right as the group is getting all there praise.
- Linette and the town folks deeply thank the party for saving the town. She will give Gail his boots.
- During Barton Bedrock is temporalily elected Town Master and Ulfric will be offered the title of Sherrif of Tuntin until a more sitable replacement can be found. If one of the players takes a liking them might be considered for the position of sheriff. He offers the town the remaining bronze coins that the town mayor hasn't spent or luandered. The original contract that Krater negotiated was roughly 150 bc, though they could only scrounge together 128 bc and 38 cc. It is obvious that the towns people don't have much money as there town has Fallen on hard times. Taking this money will bankrupt the town finacially. Instead of the money, Barton will instead offer the deed to Rozen Manor.
- Interogating Glassmith and the town master (if alive) reveals that the Spider's web pact is trying to muscle into the surrounding area, all to find and control a mysterous mine called Tide Echo Cave. In exchange for the staying of his execution and instead imprisonment, Glassmith will give addiontal information, revealing the best way to tear apart the spider's web pact, targeting the weaker threads, slowly unraveling and weaking the various factions gaining them leverage or information over the Black Spider Nezzarna.
- The
