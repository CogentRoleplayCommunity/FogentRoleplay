# Spider's Web Pact

Proposed in this document is an offer of non-aggression, cooperation and friendship between all parties. Through this alliance, each party benefits.

Upon determining the location of the Tide Echo Tunnel, The Black Spider will secure the assest so each of the following may be achieved:


1. The Lavender Lancers and residents of Tuntin will be considered off-limits to any unprovoked violence so Sylas may focus on securing a legal claim.
2. The Mountain Maw Clan will maintain sovereignty in their territory and recieve resources and aid to repair the castle.
3. The Warriors of Wyrm Tor will enjoy first picking rights on the treasures of the mine.
4. The Black Spider will retain sole wonership of the Forge of Runes and exclusive rights to its produce.

Signed:

- Sylas Alabaster
- King Grom
- Brugore Axe-Catcher
- Nezzarna
