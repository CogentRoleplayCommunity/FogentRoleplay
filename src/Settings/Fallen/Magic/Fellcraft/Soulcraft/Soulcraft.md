# Soulcraft

Soulcraft users can narratively attempt the following:

- Forge souls (Non-conscious souls)
- Manipulate/bind souls
- Animate bodies (organic and non-organic)
- Communicate with Lost Souls
- Feed on souls
- Resit spiritual attacks
- Astral projection and interaction
- Astral Sense (Assist for Perception checks)
- Phase though material objects (non-silver or Runecraft)
- Posses

Users of Soulcraft learn to consciously control and strengthen their own soul. This allows them to communicate, bend, dominate, and even feed the souls of the Lost and the living. Users learn how to cross the barrier of the material plane into the astral plane.

Depending on the morality and spiritual strength of an individual, their personal spiritual projections appearance will change. Soulcraft users can also see the souls of the living. Generally a bright soul means a person is moral/ethical. Whereas, generally someone with a dark soul that pulls in all the light around them means a person is immoral/unethical. It should be noted that this is only based on how the individual perceives their own actions. A tyrant that fully believes in his cause could have a soul as bright as a saint.

#### The Way of the Wraith

When an individual dies without descendants, their soul wanders aimlessly on the material plane. These ghosts of Fellkind are preyed upon Wraith, monsters that have learned to interact and feed on the lost souls of the continent. Wraiths tend to lurk in places of death. They will not leave their dwellings to hunt for the living. Though, if an unfortunate soul wanders within, the wraith will of course consume the soul of their victim.

#### Specialization: The Undead Dragon

Soulfire is legendary in its destructive capabilities. Soul fire produces cold and is fueled by soul/life energy. It has a greenish/purple appearance and flickers much more slowly than regular fire. Undead Dragons channel this from the elemental scales that cover their bodies.

##### Soulfire

Allows the user to breathe soulfire from their mouth. This energy has a mind of its own, leaping from soul to soul. The raw destructive power is terrifying, as given the right circumstance things can quickly go out of hand.

#### Absorb Fellblood: Souls

Souls can be absorbed and feed on to regain Fellblood. Victim can not resist. An extra point of Fellblood should be awarded if a Fellkin or Brightkin is consumed.
