#### Fellcraft Combination

This Fellcraft can only be accessed by users with a specialization in Polycraft and Toxicant. The lowest dice total of the required Fellcraft will be used for this Fellcraft.

#### Specialization: The Giant Spider

#### Absorb Fellblood: Liquify Prey

Prey can be absorbed to regain Fellblood. This can be done by mummifying the prey and injecting a digestive toxin. After some time, the digested prey can be drunk from, resulting in an extra +1 Fellblood. Also gain an additional +1 Fellblood if the prey is a monster or Fellkin...

#### Spider Climb

By achieving a CL 3 check, for the cost of 1 Fellblood a character may gain the ability to stick to walls like a spider. The user gains automatic wins to climb checks equal to their Spidercraft skill.  This effect has a duration of 1 hour.
