### The Sun of Terra

The radiant Sun of Terra exhibits a mesmerizing cycle of colors. It initiates its celestial journey with a gentle warmth, casting a luminous yellowish glow upon the land. As the cycle progresses, the Sun transitions into captivating shades of orange and red, illuminating the sky with an enchanting radiance. Gradually, it grows in size, commanding a more prominent presence above Terra. At the culmination of its cycle, a magnificent burst of light emanates, drawing the star back together and restoring its initial warm yellow hue. Although the exact duration of this cycle varies, it typically occurs every 3-5 months.

The sprawling Continent stretches across the vast expanse of Terra, its colossal size dominating a large portion of the planet. Legend speaks of the Brights, in their valiant conquest of Terra, harnessing the power of mighty magma dragons and formidable wyrms dwelling deep within the planet's tectonic plates. These creatures, brought under the control of the Brights, played a pivotal role in unifying the fragmented landmasses of Terra, forging a cohesive and interconnected continent. Their subjugation became a testament to the indomitable spirit and dominion of the Brights over the sprawling lands they sought to conquer.
