## Backstory

Vex'halia or Vex to her friend's, was born as the only child of Lady Veronica and Lord Flint Reddington. Sickly with dull white hair, Vex's childhood was mostly spent at the various royal hospitals across Reddwall. Her mother Veronica, spent every waking hour of both her and Vex's time looking for a cure to Vex's mysterious condition.

Eventually, after her mother repeatedly refused to allow her father Flint to seek other medical experts across Terra, Flint took Vex in secret from Reddwall. Flint and a small crew of his sailed to various healer's across the globe looking for answers. During their travels, they were set upon by hostile ships during a storm who later turned out to be cultist of the Cult of Amon. While they were successfully able to defeat the attacker due to Flint's years as a pirate capitan, Vex was thrown overboard.

Vex awoke on a mysterious tropical island. Many of the cultist had also washed up. Vex was saved by a strange boy roughly her age who lived on the island. The two of them stuck together, narrowly avoiding death from the cultists. The strange boy Vex named Killroy, after her ancestor Serana Reddington's legendary bodyguard. Killroy didn't speak any languages so Vex taught him. Killroy taught Vex about survival on the island. The two grew inseparable, with only each other to rely on. They spent 4 years surviving on the large island. In that time, Vex's condition subsided went away, her hair changing from a dull white to a vibrant red.

Vex and Killroy were rescued by Flint, who had never stopped looking for her. Returning to Reddwall, Vex had to adjust back to civilized life. She did her best to teach Killroy the proper etiquette of court, though even she thought is was silly after living on in the wilderness for 4 years. Not long after her return, Luc Lightbringer, the heir to the Dawn Empire and her future betrothed due to an arranged marriage arrived in Reddwall to train with the master swordman Flint Reddington. Luc was handsome, strong, intelligent, and funny. As she settled back into her noble life style, she grew closer with Luc.

During a unapproved trip from Reddwall, Vex, Luc, and Killroy were attack by a trench lurker while swimming at a secluded pond.

When Vex was 15, Killroy and Luc snuck out of Reddwall to enjoy the summer heat and go swimming a secret pond that Luc had heard about. While Vex'halia and Luc had planned to go alone, once Killroy got wind he insisted he come. Vex'halia, terrified of any water she couldn't stand in, eventually told Killroy he could come. Upon arriving at the secluded pond outside of Reddwall, the 3 went swimming, with Vex staying in the shallow end. Luc swam to the middle, playfully taunting Vex, before being dragged beneath the waves by a trench lurker, a monster known to carry shard's disease. Fearing for Luc's life, Vex asked Killroy to swim out and help Luc. While he was successful as rescuing Luc, Killroy was caught instead, being dragged to the bottom of the pond by the monster.

Flint Reddington, had caught wind that Vex and Luc where planning to sneak out decided to tail the trio that day. Bored by his lordly duties, Flint with rum in hand jumped at the opportunity to sneakily tail the trio on a beautiful summer day, reminding of his youthful days of adventure. Ensuring there would be no funny business, Flint set up for a nap with a clear sight of the pond. Upon awaking to the screaming of his daughter, Flint jumped into action. An expert swimmer and no stranger to fighting underwater monsters, Flint slew the trench lurker. He dragged the shredded body of Killroy to the surface, dumping every vial of healing blood on hand into him before racing towards Reddwall.

Killroy died more than once on the operating table, with only the masterful skill of Lady Reddington keeping him through. While he was saved from certain death, his fate was now far worse as he was infected with shard's disease. Despite his debilitating disease and short outlook on life, Killroy is remarkably positive. Vex grew distant after the incident, blaming herself for causing Killroy's ill fate.
