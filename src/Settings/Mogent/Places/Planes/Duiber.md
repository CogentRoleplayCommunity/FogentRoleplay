Duiber is a place most embodied by spring. Its colder climate is caused partially by its distance from the Light, but also due to its mountainous terrain. The natural world remains mostly untouched, and its inhabitants invest a lot of effort into taking care of it. While a harsh plane for the unprepared, those favored by the locals will find it an incredibly peaceful part of Dunyor.

Duiberans care deeply about nature and each being’s place in it. Their cities match the biome they are located in and are made to be one with their surroundings. Duiberans are organized into family lines, clans, all belonging to a greater tribe. Every clan has a Prea, a witch matriarch tasked with religious matters and interpreting the divine will of ravens, and a Jarren, a patriarch who carries out the Prea’s commands. Duiberans consider their clan structures sacred, and tradition is held in high regard. They mostly adhere to the nature-oriented teachings of Halice, but also respect the ideals of Trumst in certain aspects of life. They believe in harsh punishments for those arrogant enough to disrespect their elders and natural forces.

Duiberans care most of all about their communities. In every aspect of day to day life their families play an important role. From communal parenting to shared living spaces, they rely on each other whenever they can.
