A plane characterized by numerous geysers and multiple volcanoes, it has the hottest climate in all of Dunyor. Temperatures on the surface frequently reach unbearable levels so its inhabitants have to find reprieve in the shade of geographical features. Due to its proximity to the Light, its days can reach up to 20 hours of length, leaving little room for rest. While perilous for humans, this hostile environment is perfect for various species of dragons and other lizards.

Agmarians are known for their various innovations and mastery of thermal energy. From hot air balloons to steam engines, their pursuit of technological development rivals only that of the Eterians. They mostly live in underground cave networks, though some settlements have developed in the shade of large mountains. Due to the dangerous nature of the plane’s surface, they prefer to travel through underground tunnels and have even developed prototypical trains. On the other hand, a sizable portion of the Agmarians has embraced the nomadic lifestyle, traveling the thunderous skies on dragonback. The nomads use large airships as their bases of operation, using them as a sort of hangar for their dragons.

Agmarians are split on the conflict between safety and freedom. While the cave dwellers consider their nomadic brethren somewhat primitive, the dragon riders couldn’t care less for the opinions of those below them, for they are likely the freest of beings in all of Dunyor.
