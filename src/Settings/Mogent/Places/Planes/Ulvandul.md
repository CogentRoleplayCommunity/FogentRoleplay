Ulvandul is different to other planes in the sense that it is not a region that fractured, but an amalgamation of bits and pieces of other regions. The whole plane is covered by an endless ocean (literally, someone stuck at the edges wouldn’t even know it) from all sides but above. While the sea floor exists in some places, there exist numerous records of bottomless pits leading to nowhere. The entire plane feels fractured even on the inside and is known to be incredibly dangerous and difficult to navigate. What little people have settled it have gathered around small archipelagos sprinkled about.

The people of Ulvandul are not singular in culture and are in fact among the most diverse group of planar residents. As each group was taken from various sides of Dunyor, they have no common roots and often share cold relations. While distrustful of one another, they prefer to avoid open conflict due to the scarcity of resources. What conflict there is is usually between adventurers and treasure hunters on the unforgiving open seas.

Ulvandul is terrifying to those who weren’t born there. The air feels unpleasant to breathe, the ocean and the sky meld into one and the gaping abyss below will disturb even the most stoic of individuals. The people of Ulvandul have accepted this fully and see no issue with it, making them seem insane to outsiders. If being and feeling alone is what you seek, you will find no place better.
