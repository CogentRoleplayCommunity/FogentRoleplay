## Lore

The Twisting One, known by different names across various cultures, such as the "World Serpent" of the Isles of Crest, the "Ouroboros" of Leodelphia, and the "Leviathan" of Reddwall, represents a singular entity of immense proportions, said to encircle the foundations of the world. Revered for symbolizing want, growth, and change, the Twisting One is worshiped by the Seakin, Sailors, and those seeking radical transformations in their lives.

Legend speaks of the Bright Lord bestowing wings upon certain offspring of the Twisting One, which gave rise to the first dragons.

The massive movements of the Twisting One deep beneath the oceanâ€™s surface are believed to give rise to phenomena such as dry storms and oceanic currents. It is even theorized that earthquakes and fissures on Terra are the result of its movements along the seafloor, leaving gargantuan gashes in the bedrock itself.

Its impenetrable scales are said to render it impervious to physical weapons. Remarkably, a scale from the Twisting One has been discovered deep within the Earth near the Iris Sea in the Dawn Empire, painstakingly harvested to forge exceptional armor and weapons. These scaled artifacts are said to grant longevity and vitality to their wielders.

Eyewitness accounts of the Twisting One's immense body, as known in the Dawn Empire, are plentiful. Many mistakenly perceive parts of its body as islands or landmasses.

Dark and colossal scales cover every inch of the creature, rendering it practically indestructible. While sightings of its body parts are relatively common, encounters with its head are rare due to its gargantuan size. Survivors who have witnessed its head describe it as eclipsing the sun itself. Its eyes emit a red glow reminiscent of the dawn's rays, while smoke billows from its nostrils, occasionally igniting with bursts of light. Direct eye contact with the creature is said to petrify onlookers, and it exhales storms of fire.
