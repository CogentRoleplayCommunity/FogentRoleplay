## Vex Monologue

Want: She wants to stop being sick. She wants to escape the island.

Need: She needs to learn to survive the island and the "pirates".

Why are they different: Escape from this is difficult due to it's unknown location.

Why can't they have either one:

"Where have I been all this time? 

Well, as you may have heard, my father wisked me away aboard his ship without mother's approval. My birth was difficult, on me and my mother. I was born very weak and had it not been for the genuis care provided to me by my Lady mother, I'm sure I'd not be recounting this to you.

As the sole hier to House Reddington, my health was of top priority for both the kingdom and my parents. My mother became obsessed with curing me of my mysterious illness. My symtoms included weakness, frality, eradic heart beat, and more than I care to remember. From 0 - 12 I was hospitalized more times than I could count. It baffeld my mother how a Dhampir with as high of a blood purity content was prone to illness as I was. I think she blamed herself for my condition, as my mother was told by doctors she'd never bear a child. 

My Lord Father, was my constant companion when he wasn't attending to his duties. He'd read me tales of his adventures in his youth, sailing the seas surounding the Continient, fighting other pirates and monsters of the depths, and capturing my mother. He could always make me laugh and made my isolation room somewhat bearable, life was very lonely. Most days I was there, too sick to get out of bed or forbade from leaving it due to the risk of infection, other diseases, yada yada. I would hear him and mother fight when they thought I wasn't listening. Father wanted to take me to other experts around the continent, claiming there was nothing left to try with Reddlandian medicine. My mother forbade it, insisting that she would find a way to fix me...

One late night, my father snuck into my room and whisked me away onto his ship. We sailed from Reddwall in the secret of night. My father told me that we were going to adventure around the world until we found someone that could help me. When I asked about mom, he said we'd see her in time, but that sometimes it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission. And we did for over 6 months. Life on the sea was hard on me, but just not being stuck in that room gave me a purpose. I made friends with all the crew, I learned all the names of the sea life we came across, and even learned how to defend myself with a blade, though dad recommened that if I was in a real fight, I should just use my gift with Mindcraft.

That was until that fateful night. The night sea air felt heavenly for my headache as I stood on the deck looking out into the sea. Their ships came out of no where. My father and the crew fought the attacker but in the battle I was flung over board.

The first I remember was a seagull pecking at my eye. I awoke on a beach among some of the wreckage of the battle. I was in bad shape and began searching for help. One of the attackers spotted me and chased me. He pushed me to the ground and got on top of me. He tried to... The next thing I new a rock clipped him in the head. I scrambled away and then I saw him. He had long brown hair and skin tanned by the sun. He was my age, maybe a bit younger. He was almost completely naked aside from some leaf garment fashioned for his boy bits. He sprung on my stunnded downed attacker and wooden stake stabbed him to death.

Then he turn to me, and then I saw his eyes. They were blueish green, like the ocean... he wanted to kill me. He was on me before I could stop me. He hands wrapped around my throat as I screamed for help. In some desperate last attempt at life, I instintively ripped into his mind with whatever strength of Mindcraft I could. Later I realized I enthralled his mind, but in the moment my nearly went unconscious from the strain. His eyes burned with a yellow glow as his face went blank. I scrambled to my feet and ran.
