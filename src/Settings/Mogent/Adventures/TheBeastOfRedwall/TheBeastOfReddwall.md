### Javk Wick Character creation guidelines

While this story is suppose to be a avenue for your players to create their own interesting character's, some general guide lines will help them maximize they're enjoyment of this adventure.

- No joke characters. A character cracking jokes is great, but someone roleplaying Spongebob ruins the tone for everyone.
- No anti-social characters. Much of the fun of this adventure will be interacting with other players, while your character can be guarded, if they never eventually open up and connect the story will suffer. Why would people who hate each other stick together?
- Player characters can't start as evil, though they can become so naturally over the story. It is far more interesting to watch a character you have a connection with fall to evil than just having a random evil character your character is expected to get along with.

## Act 1

### Current state of Reddwall

Before running this campaign, it is advised to read about Reddland and Reddwall.

Currently crowded beyond belief as desperate travelers from around Terra flock to Reddwall for healing blood a unique export of Reddwall and the only know cure for Spore infection.

Player will begin the game in two different way. If they are coming from outside of Reddwall, than they will arrive by boat at the Reddwall docks. If they are natives to Reddwall, they will pop up later as friends of a character named Killroy who will allow the player to stay with him in the crowded city.

### Arriving on the Docks

If a player character is not a native of Reddwall they will arrive via boat at the Beached Bay dock. 

"The scale of the legendary Great Redd Wall is in full display as the boat approaches port. Standing ~160 feet tall and 40 feet thick of dull red marble. The Great Redd Wall encircles Reddwall in it's entirety, weathered by the thousands of years it has stood guard over the city. Enormous archways are the only know way into the city, which during times of attack can shut via enormous runecraft powered gates.

The dock of Reddwall sits upon Beached Bay, who's unnaturally clear waters allow one to see the very ocean floor and marine life beneath. The mysteriously clear waters act as a constant reminder of the previous Siren Ruler's of this land, the ruins of their former capital laying the foundation of modern day Reddwall. Boat flow in and out of Reddwall continuously as those that have received treatment return to their distant homes and those that are seeking treatment begin the time consuming process of starting their blood healing treatments."

As the boat approaches the grizzled seakin boat captain will order everyone to begin gathering there things. As the player begin to gather their possessions, a young felinekin girl named Svelte will attempt to pickpocket the wealthiest looking player.

Commander Sarah Royce, a Dhampir officer and head of the Redd Legion garrison stationed in Reddwall, will be waiting with her guards as the boat arrives. She is on the look out for a know Dhampir con-artist named Tigward Bloodrose. Seeing the strong presence of the guard, Tigward will attempt to persuade one of the player's to cause a distraction to allow him to escape. He will pretend to be a wrongly accused man seeking out his kidnapped lover in Reddwall and promises to repay the player at a later date. This is all a farce and if Tigward escapes he will find the nearest inn to begin his conns on unsuspecting marks. If the player decided to instead turn over Tigward, she will give them the 30 bronze coin reward for his capture.

Commander Royce, extremely kind and always sure to take extra care of unaccompanied children will personally escort the players an Svelte towards the medical district of Reddwall using her Ironbreed (an runecraft wooden horse made of ironwood).

"Passing through the gargantuan arch of the Great Redd wall, the magnitude of the city is on full display. Massive gothic marble structures dominate the city. The smaller marble structures close to by are of varying earth tone colors. Looking out into the city a massive deep red marble castle (Castle Tearstone) is in full view. The slightly smaller, though still enormous structures placed nearest to the castle have a red hue, with each subsequent structure becoming smaller, fading to orange in color, than yellow or earth tones relative to the current vantage point."

As the player's are taken through the streets Commander Royce will inform the group to be careful. The city is packed to the gills and various small gangs have begun to pop up without enough guards to patrol. She will take the player's towards the Medical District, laying in close proximity to both Castle Tearstone and Byrgenwerth University. Upon entering the medical district, she will take them to the Royal Hospital of Reddwall. She will explain as ward of the state, Lady Veronica Reddington will be personally handling their first round of healing blood treatments, as she does with all wards of the state.

"As you enter the multi-story deep red marble building clearly labeled "Byrgenwerth University Veronica Reddington Hospital", you pear up seeing the various balconies of each level, reachable via grand red marble staircases. Patients in gowns lean upon the balconies and nurses neatly pressed white uniforms move quickly onto their next tasks. The smell of lye and soap ever present in your nostrils. Four guards, two by the doors and two standing near the path past the front desk stand idle. A young Dhampir nurse at the front desk looks up from some paper work motioning the group over."

The nurse at the front desk will welcome the group to the hospital and admit them. Commander Royce will ask where Lady Reddington is currently, and is instructed towards her personal study on the top floor. Leading the group up the grand staircase and towards Lady Reddington, Commander Royce will knock politely on the door. A serpentkin man sitting nearby in fine white, tan, and gold clothes sits near by and will look up from his notebook. Severus Koa'tak, ambassador of the Dawn Empire and doctor, is waiting impatiently to meet with Lady Reddington about disclosing the secret recipe of the healing blood of Reddwall to the Dawn Empire. Severus will try and shoo away the group as his is far more important and has been trying desperately to meet with Lady Reddington. Royce, responsible for the personal security of house Reddington, will remind Severus that there is an official meeting in a weeks time, which Severus will be flustered by.

Lady Reddington, a beautiful, motherly, and warm Dhampir woman in doctors attire with intricately braided red hair and piercing purple eyes will open the door. She will blow off Severus much to his dismay and welcome the children into her office. Upon entering, they will notice a beautiful red haired Dhampir young woman with green eye and barely noticeably freckles in simple if slightly dirty clothes. It is obvious that this young woman is related to Lady Reddington as they share many of their features. Lady Reddington will ask "And where do you think your going young lady, we still need to finish our conversion". Vex'halia Reddington, rolling her eyes and sighing will respond "I though our conversation was on pause since you've got patents to look after, I'll meet you back home...". Lady Reddwall, looking frustrated at her daughter will tell her that she will just have to wait and that when their treatment is over they can resume their conversation. She will then ask Vex to gather the supplies from the cabinet as lady Reddington prepares each of the players including Svelte for their blood transfusions with healing blood.

The treatment will take roughly 30 min, during which Lady Veronica will ask the party about where they are from, give them the run down on Reddwall, and introduce them to her daughter Vex. If Vex thinks any of the player's are particularly interesting she will chat with them. If any of them are particularly friendly ( Communications check) she may even extended an offer for them to hangout at Castle Tearstone. Lady Reddington will inform the children that the traditional housing they provide wards of the state are completely full. Instead, she informs them that a close family, Killroy Crimson (general knowledge check revealing that Crimson is the last name given bastards and wards of the state). He has a humble warehouse were they can stay while they are in the city. Vex will noticeably pay attention when Killroy's name is mentioned.

Allowing the party to wait for the remain blood transfusion to complete, she will lead Vex into an adjacent room to privately finish the rest of there talk. Vex just today punched Luc Lightbringer, heir to the Dawn Empire and Vex's future betrothed, for making a harmless though insensitive joke about how fragile Mudbloods are. Vex is still extremely guilty about how Killroy has been diagnosed with Shards disease, a death sentence, and something she feels personally responsible for.

When Lady Reddington leaves, Svelte is gonna try to steal a spyglass sitting on Lady Reddington's table. She will promise to split the money with the player if they keep quite, though she never will.

After they have received blood, Lady Reddington will ask Vex to bring the group to The Weeping Anvil. Vex will escort them through the city toward the Diligence district where the Weeping Anvil is located. She ask they party to be especial kind to Killroy, as a couple months ago he was gravely injured and has never fully recovered despite her mothers best attempts. If she is persuaded, she will tell the group that during the summer, Vex, Killroy, and one of her "friends" (Luc Lightbringer) snuck away from Reddwall to go swimming at a secluded lake that she had read about in one of her Uncle Maxwell's old journals. Vex is afraid of any water she can't stand in, but was convinced by her "friend" as he wanted to get in some swimming before the summer was over. While swimming, her friend was attacked and pulled beneath the water by a monster called a Lurker. Killroy had swam out and managed to free this "friend", but was caught instead. Vex will not disclose that it was she that asked Killroy to help Luc, as she was too scared to swim out and Lurkers are know to carry shards disease, which can kill brightkin.

Vex will take them close enough to the weeping anvil and tell them to continue down the street. Vex, still guilt ridden about what she did to one of the people she cares most for in this world, will not wants to see Killroy in his damaged state. Vex and Killroy have an extremely strong connection, so much so that through there mental link manifested through Vex's mindcraft, she can feel the pain and love Killroy has for her.

As evening approaches, the party will happen upon the Weeping Anvil, though trouble is amiss. A local gang of teenage thugs know as the the Beast's of Reddwall, sporting purple arm bands, are currently beating the snot out of Killroy. While two thugs pick on the injured Killroy, the Beast of Reddwall's second in command named Lance is stealing a bag of Killroy's tinkering tools and equipment. The thugs will not back down, brandishing knives, clubs, slings, and fists if interfered with. If the party is beaten up, the gang will Rob them and leave. If the group is successful, Lance will run away in the confusion with Killroy's tools.

One the Beast of Reddwall have ran away or left in victory. Killroy if injured badly enough will go into a seizure, black veins becoming visible under his skin. Killroy looks to be a 15 year old After recovering, Killroy will invite the party inside, providing vials of Minor Healing Factor Blood if player's are to beat up.
