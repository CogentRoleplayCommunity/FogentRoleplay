## Miracles

Miracles are either created from from a bright/god or brightkin/demigod.

When the Bright Lord gave onto the first loyal women of Fellkind his children, the resulting offspring were the first Brightkin of Terra. Brightkin have the ability to perform miracles like the Bright Lord himself, known as Miracles. To perform Miracles, Ichor is channeled through specific strong emotion or memories to receive a desired effect. Miracles require training and practice to use, harnessing one's emotions. Most Brightkin don't devote themselves to mastering all aspects of Miracles, though they enjoy the benefits of near immortality.

Priests act as divine conduits via their belief, devotion and/or relationship with a divine entity who actually manifest the power of miracles.  Those that are devoted to divine entity can barrow a fraction of their gods power for their own use.

Maintaining one's physical health restores Ichor/Faith gradually over time. This can be done by maintaining adequate nutrition, hydration, sleep, and stress levels.

#### Absorb Ichor/Faith

Brightkin can absorb Ichor via ample sources of light (such as the Sun) or by drawing on powerful emotion/memories. They can also regain ichor if mortals worship them.

Divine Conduits can absorb Faith from ample sources of their deity's domain.

### Wonders

Wonders are uses of Miracles that use an insignificant amount of Ichor/Faith. In general, Wonders should be small and happen close to the user. Making your hand a flashlight, making your eyes grow faintly, or making small illusions are examples of Wonders. Wonders can be used even if the user's Ichor is completely depleted.
