# Blessing

Users of Blessing can narratively attempt the following:

- Bind light to themselves and others
- Heal themselves and others

While Radiance focuses on the manipulation of external light, Blessing focuses on the manipulation of light within the body. Blessings can be used to enhance or repair physical characteristics.

When the user is under the effect of a Blessing they will begin to glow with wisps of light.

#### Specialization: Bright's Heritage

With sufficient Ichor, Brightkin can resurrect upon death. The Brightkin's body will begin to glow brightly, damaged tissue pulled back together or is regrown.

- Must succeed a check starting at CL 6, decreasing each round of combat or every 10 seconds outside of combat.
- If the user does not have enough Ichor, they can absorb Ichor given they are exposed to sunlight.
- Resurrection restores the user to peak health. This includes regrowing limbs.
- Objects lodged in the body will remain, and may lead to injury or death upon resurrection.

Known counters to this ability are driving instruments into the brain of a fallen Brightkin and burying them deep underground where no light can reach them.

#### Absorb Ichor: Emotion

Powerful emotions or memories can be meditated on to regain Ichor. A user must describe the powerful emotion in detail. If the Narrator agrees the emotion or memory is sufficient, then the user's inner light will surge, regaining Ichor.
