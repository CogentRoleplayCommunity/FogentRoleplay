# Magic

This document provides generalized framework for magic system mechanics for any setting. Whether it be the Force, Bending from Avatar, Cyberpunk technomancy, or tractional fantasy magic, this systems should easily accommodate. All magic systems built using this require the following pieces of information to be determined.

- Magic Name
- Magic Vocation Name
- Magic Vocation Governing Attributes
- Magic Resource Name
- Cantrip Name
- Governing Core Skill
- Spell Name

## Fallen Magic Systems

Fallen's pre-made magic systems are great examples of how to make your own system on this framework. Once the framework is understood, all three of Fallen's magic systems are quite easy to understand, acting as roleplay considerations or flavor.

### [Fellcraft](Fellcraft/Fellcraft.md)

### [Miracles](Miracles/Miracles.md)

### [Runecraft](Runecraft/Runecraft.md)

## Unlocking Magic

You unlock an amount of Magic Skill depending on your Magic Vocation level. All magic skills start at the level -1 (incompetent).

### Party Trick Tier (Level -1: Incompetent)

Requires an investment of 0 skill point to unlock. Generally acquired during character creation or through narrative means. Examples include:

* A minuet latent genetic potential, such as from the race of the character. (Sorcerer)
* Partial knowledge of a type of magic learned quickly on the fly without the required study to be considered a novice. (Wizard)
* A minuet blessing bestowed by a deity. (Cleric)
* A taste of power from an entity looking to make a deal... (Warlock)
* A part of nature foreign to your place of origin. (Druid)

This level of proficiency with magic might be a fun party trick or for convenience but has no awe inspiring use. Those with this level are objectively bad at using this skill. A fire magic skill would allow you to ignite your finger tips to light a cigar, though you could just use a match, flint and steel, or a lighter. You could throw hot smoke at someones face, though you could just punch them in the face instead for similar if not better results.

| Magic Vocation Level | Magic Vocational Skills known |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| -1                   | 1                             |
| 0                    | 2                             |
| 1                    | 3                             |
| 2                    | 4                             |
| 3                    | 5                             |
| 4                    | 6                             |

## Magic Skills

These magic skills represent generic types of magic representing different concepts. Skill in one of these represents the ability to manipulate and control the concept.

If you are making a magic system, these will probably have different names in your system. This is not an exhaustive list, feel free to add your own.

- Bodily Magic (Flesh, Web, Bone, ect...)
- Heat Magic
- Water Magic
- Electricity Magic
- Earth Magic
- Air Magic
- Cold Magic
- Plant Magic
- Poison Magic
- Soul Magic
- Light Magic
- Shadow Magic
- Mind Magic
- Metal Magic
- Sound Magic
- Blood Magic
- Acid Magic
- Time Magic
- Space Magic
- Gravity Magic

### Combo Magic Skill

Another avenue to explore are magic how these magics could be combined.

- Plasma Magic = Heat Magic + Air Magic
- Storm Magic = Air Magic + Electricity Magic + Water Magic
- Magma Magic = Earth Magic + Heat Magic
- Blizzard Magic = Cold Magic + Air Magic

## Governing Core Skill

A governing core skill is used for instances when a character over exerts themselves with their magic too far, is trying to rapidly regain Magic Resource, or maintain a concentration on already cast magic.

* Magic that rely on the body to produce Magic Resource (such as Fallen's Fellcraft) use Endurance as their governing core skill.
* Magic that relies on the mind or spirit to produce Magic Resource (such as Fallen's Runecraft or Miracles) use Will as their governing core skill.
* Magic that relies upon a belief in a divine higher power might use Will as their governing core skill.
* Magic that relies upon a relationship with a divine being or a pact with a nefarious entity could use Communication, as it is only through the connection to the entity that the magic is held together.
* Magic that relies upon ones connection with nature could use Survival.

### Magic Concentration

Certain magic demand your concentration to keep their effects active. If you lose this concentration, the spell's magic ends.

If a spell necessitates concentration, the Duration entry of the spell will indicate this, and it will specify how long you can concentrate on it. You can stop concentrating at any time.

Regular activities, like moving or attacking, don't disturb your concentration. However, the following factors can disrupt your concentration:

* Casting another spell that requires concentration. If you cast a spell that needs concentration while you're focusing on a different spell, you lose concentration on the first spell. You can't concentrate on two spells simultaneously.
* Suffering damage. If you take damage while focusing on a spell, you must make a governing core skill roll to maintain your concentration. The challenge level is equal to the level of injury taken. If you take damage from multiple sources, you make a separate saving throw for each injury source.
* Becoming incapacitated or dying. If you're incapacitated or die, you lose concentration on a spell.
* The Narrator might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave washing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a Challenge level 2 governing core skill check.

## Magic Resource

Magic Resources are consumed to use magic.

- +3 to Magic Resource pool per Magic Vocation level
- +1 to Magic Resource pool per Governing Skill

### Resting for Magic Resource

Depending on your magic system, maintaining one's physical health can restore Magic Resource over time.

#### Short Resting

A short rest takes roughly 1 hour where the character does nothing demanding. Durning this time they can tend to wounds, eat, drink, or relax.

Once per day, characters can regain Magic Resource equal to the wins from their Governing Core Skill roll (remember you can assist with your Magic Vocation).

#### Long Resting

This can be done by maintaining adequate nutrition, hydration, sleep, and stress levels. A long rest of roughly 8 hours of downtime. Durning this downtime, at least 6 hours must be devoted to sleep. While being awake for no more than 2 hours of a long rest, characters can treat wounds, eat, drink, relax, and stand watch.

### Absorbing Magic Resource

Depending on your magic system, Magic users can absorb and feed on an ample source of primal elements/magic/power to regain Magic Resource using a Magic skill. This ability can be used once per day for each Magic Vocation point, resetting on long rests. The magic skill used dictates how much Magic Resource is regained determined by your skill level. If negative or zero, none is regained. Absorbing or meditating near a large source of the elements/magic/power are acceptable. Flavor and creativity are encouraged.

## Magic Conduit

All magic needs a conduit to be cast through wether a wizards staff, a druids focus, or even your own body. Just about anything can be made into a conduit from a narrative perspective, but it is up to the narrator to decide if their are any restrictions.

Example Conduit:

| Name               | One<br />Handed | Two<br />Handed | Dual<br /> Wielded | Additional<br />Penetration | Range<br />Adjustment | Additional<br />Damage<br />Types | Engageable<br />Opponents | Area Of<br />Effect | Resource<br />Class | Effected<br />Magic Skills |
| ------------------ | --------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Blazecraft Conduit | +1d6            | +1d6            | None               | 0                           | 0                     |                                   | None                      | None                | None                | Blazecraft                 |

- One Handed: Dice bonus given by wielding the conduit in one hand.

- Two Handed: Dice Bonus given by wielding the conduit in two hand. Narratively this could be requiring the character to channel magic through both hands for greater effect.

- Dual Wielded: Dice bonus given when wielding two conduits that are both capable of being dual wielded that effect the same magic skill. Think dual wielding fire magic wands.

- Additional Penetration: Extra penetration added to combat rolls made with this conduit, added to the normal penetration.

- Range Adjustment: Increase or decrease range calculation for magic skill (see Magic Range Adjustment below).

- Additional Damage Types: Extra damage types to be added onto combat rolls made with this conduit.

- Engageable Opponents: Changes engageable opponent type when making a combat roll. This could be a fast shooting wand or a slow shooting staff that pacts a large wallop.

- Area Of Effect: Adds an innate area of effect to every combat roll made with the conduit. This is very powerful.

- Resource Class: Additional resource consumed by the conduit when used.

- Effected Magic Skills: Which Magic skill the conduit can be used with.

## Magic Roll

This roll represents your abilities with a specific type of Magic skill. A minimum of one Resource is required to make a non-Cantrip Magic Roll. Resources up to the level in the user's Magic vocation can be consumed, adding an additional d6 to the Magic Roll for each Magic Resource consumed.

- Magic Skill Roll = 3d6 (base) + Xd6 (Magic Skill) + Xd6 (Vocation Attributes) + Xd6 (Resource consumed capped by Magic Vocation level) + Xd6 (Conduit Dice Modification)

### Overcharging Magic

When casting magic with additional resource above the level allowed by your Magic Vocation level, the magic can have erratic behavior. Roll a d20 to determine the nature of the behavior.

| d20 | Runecraft Malfunction table                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 1   | You suddenly realize that you are nothing more than a fictional character in a game played by other creatures in another plane of existence, which causes you to be stunned. This existential crisis lasts until the start of your next turn, after which you shake it off as nonsense. |
| 2   | You become petrified for 1d10 rounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 3   | A clone of the caster appears, desperately claiming to be the original.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 5   | All doors and windows within 60' of the caster fly open.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 6   | You permanently lose the ability to smell. This sense can be restored with a spell that removes curses such as remove curse.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 7   | The spell's target becomes overwhelmed by a desire to eat the caster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 8   | The caster and target are flung 10' in opposite directions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Magic Skills in Combat

- Character's can't cast magic twice in one round of combat unless specified otherwise

#### Magic Range adjustment

If a Magic Skill has a range adjustment it is either moved up or down the table above. Ranged attacks can not fall below Close Range.

For instance if I have a level 3 Magic skill with a -1 Magic Range adjustment, my magic skill has an Extended Range Type.

## Magic Spells

Magic Spells are more complex types of magic that behave in very specific ways. Depending on the magic discipline, your may not contains any spells at all. However it is generally encouraged since they are loved by players and narrators alike.
