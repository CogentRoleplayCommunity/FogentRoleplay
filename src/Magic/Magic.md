# Magic

This document provides generalized rules for magic system mechanics built to integrate with Cogent Roleplay. Once understood, all three of Fallen's magic systems are quite easy to understand, acting as roleplay considerations or flavor. If you are playing Fallen, you will probably just use the premade magic systems. But if you were wanting to make your own magic system for your own world, the generalized magic system mechanics are a great scaffolding.

- Magic Name = Fellcraft/Miracles/Runecraft
- Magic Vocation = Fellkin/Brightkin/Runesmith
- Magic Resource = Ichor/Light/Focus
- Cantrip = Trick/Wonder/Sign
- Governing Core Skill = Endurance/Communication/Willpower
- Spell = Fellweave/DivineTale/CompoundRune

## Fallen Magic Systems

### [Fellcraft](Fellcraft/Fellcraft.md)

### [Miracles](Miracles/Miracles.md)

### [Runecraft](Runecraft/Runecraft.md)

## Magic Skill Levels

### Level -1: Incompetent (Party Trick)

Requires an investment of 0 skill point to unlock. Generally acquired through narrative means. Examples include:

* A minuet latent genetic potential, such as from the race of the character. (Sorcerer)
* Partial knowledge of a type of magic learned quickly on the fly without the required study to be considered a novice. (Wizard)
* A minuet blessing bestowed by a deity. (Cleric)
* A taste of power from an entity looking to make a deal... (Warlock)
* A part of nature foreign to your place of origin. (Druid)

This level of proficiency with magic might be a fun party trick or for convenience but has no awe inspiring use. Those with this level are objectively bad at using this skill. A fire magic skill would allow you to ignite your finger tips to light a cigar, though you could just use a match, flint and steel, or a lighter. You could throw hot smoke at someones face, though you could just punch them in the face instead for similar if not better results.

### Level 0: Novice

Representing an inexperienced level of skill.

### Level 1: Apprentice

Representing a level of skill where the basics have been learned.

### Level 2: Adept

Skill level where the basics have been fully understood and the more advanced concepts are being learned.

### Level 3: Expert

Skill level where advanced concepts have been fully understood and master level concepts are beginning to be introduced.

### Level 4: Master

Skill level where a master level of proficiency has been achieved.

## Unlocking Magic

You unlock an amount of Magic Skill depending on your Magic Vocation level. All magic skills start at the level -1 (incompetent).

| Magic Vocation Level | Magic Vocational Skills known |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| -1                   | 1                             |
| 0                    | 2                             |
| 1                    | 3                             |
| 2                    | 4                             |
| 3                    | 5                             |
| 4                    | 6                             |

## Magic Skills

These magic skills represent every generic types of magic representing different concepts. Skill in one of these represents the ability to manipulate and control the concept.

If you are making a magic system, these will probably have different names in your system. For instance, in Fellcraft, the Heat magic skill is called Blazecraft. Your system might even leave out some of these magic skills to fine tune it for only specific uses. Lastly, this is not an exhaustive list, feel free to add your own. Happy casting. :)

- Bodily Magic (Flesh, Web, Bone, ect...)
- Heat Magic
- Water Magic
- Electricity Magic
- Earth Magic
- Air Magic
- Cold Magic
- Plant Magic
- Poison Magic
- Soul Magic
- Light Magic
- Shadow Magic
- Mind Magic
- Metal Magic
- Sound Magic
- Blood Magic
- Acid Magic
- Time Magic
- Space Magic
- Gravity Magic

### Combo Magic Skill

Another avenue to explore are magic how these magics could be combined.

- Plasma Magic = Heat Magic + Air Magic
- Storm Magic = Air Magic + Electricity Magic + Water Magic
- Magma Magic = Earth Magic + Heat Magic
- Blizzard Magic = Cold Magic + Air Magic

## Governing Core Skill

A governing core skill is used for instances when a character over exerts themselves with their magic too far, is trying to rapidly regain Magic Resource, or maintain a concentration on already cast magic.

* Magic that rely on the body to produce Magic Resource (such as Fallen's Fellcraft) use Endurance as their governing core skill.
* Magic that relies on the mind or spirit to produce Magic Resource (such as Fallen's Runecraft or Miracles) use Willpower as their governing core skill.
* Magic that relies upon a relationship with a divine being or a pact with a nefarious entity could use Communication, as it is only through the connection to the entity that the magic is held together.
* Magic that relies upon ones connection with nature could use Survival.

## Magic Resource

Magic Resources are consumed to use magic.

- +3 to Magic Resource pool per Magic Vocation level
- +1 to Magic Resource pool per Governing Skill

### Resting for Magic Resource

Depending on your magic system, maintaining one's physical health can restore Magic Resource over time.

#### Short Resting

A short rest takes roughly 1 hour does nothing demanding. Durning this time they can tend to wounds, eat, drink, or relax.

Once per day, characters can regain Magic Resource equal to the wins from their Governing Core Skill roll (remember you can assist with your Magic Vocation).

#### Long Resting

This can be done by maintaining adequate nutrition, hydration, sleep, and stress levels. A long rest of roughly 8 hours of downtime. Durning this downtime, at least 6 hours must be devoted to sleep. While being awake for no more than 2 hours of a long rest, characters can treat wounds, eat, drink, relax, and stand watch.

### Absorbing Magic Resource

Depending on your magic system, Magic users can absorb and feed on an ample source of primal elements/magic/power to regain Resource using a Magic skill. This ability can be used once per day for each Magic Vocation point, resetting on long rests. The magic skill used dictates how much Magic Resource is regained determined by your skill level. If negative or zero, none is regained. Absorbing or meditating near a large source of the elements/magic/power are acceptable. Flavor and creativity are encouraged.

## Magic Concentration

Certain magic demand your concentration to keep their effects active. If you lose this concentration, the spell's magic ends.

If a spell necessitates concentration, the Duration entry of the spell will indicate this, and it will specify how long you can concentrate on it. You can stop concentrating at any time.

Regular activities, like moving or attacking, don't disturb your concentration. However, the following factors can disrupt your concentration:

* Casting another spell that requires concentration. If you cast a spell that needs concentration while you're focusing on a different spell, you lose concentration on the first spell. You can't concentrate on two spells simultaneously.
* Suffering damage. If you take damage while focusing on a spell, you must make a governing core skill roll to maintain your concentration. The challenge level is equal to the level of injury taken. If you take damage from multiple sources, you make a separate saving throw for each injury source.
* Becoming incapacitated or dying. If you're incapacitated or die, you lose concentration on a spell.
* The Narrator might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave washing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a Challenge level 2 governing core skill check.

## Magic Conduit

All magic needs a conduit to be cast through wether a wizards staff, a druids focus, or even your own body. Just about anything can be made into a conduit from a narrative perspective, but it is up to the narrator to decide if their are any restrictions.

Example Conduit:

| Name               | One<br />Handed | Two<br />Handed | Dual<br /> Wielded | Additional<br />Penetration | Range<br />Adjustment | Additional<br />Damage<br />Types | Engageable<br />Opponents | Area Of<br />Effect | Resource<br />Class | Effected<br />Magic Skills |
| ------------------ | --------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Blazecraft Conduit | +1d6            | +1d6            | None               | 0                           | 0                     |                                   | None                      | None                | None                | Blazecraft                 |

One Handed: Dice bonus given by wielding the conduit in one hand.

Two Handed: Dice Bonus given by wielding the conduit in two hand. Narratively this could be requiring the character to channel magic through both hands for greater effect.

Dual Wielded: Dice bonus given when wielding two conduits that are both capable of being dual wielded that effect the same magic skill. Think dual wielding fire magic wands.

Additional Penetration: Extra penetration added to combat rolls made with this conduit, added to the normal penetration.

Range Adjustment: Increase or decrease range calculation for magic skill (see Magic Range Adjustment below).

Additional Damage Types: Extra damage types to be added onto combat rolls made with this conduit.

Engageable Opponents: Changes engageable opponent type when making a combat roll. This could be a fast shooting wand or a slow shooting staff that pacts a large wallop.

Area Of Effect: Adds an innate area of effect to every combat roll made with the conduit. This is very powerful.

Resource Class: Additional resource consumed by the conduit when used.

Effected Magic Skills: Which Magic skill the conduit can be used with.

## Magic Roll

This roll represents your abilities with a specific type of Magic skill. A minimum of one Resource is required to make a non-Cantrip Magic Roll. Resources up to the level in the user's Magic vocation can be consumed, adding an additional d6 to the Magic Roll for each Resource consumed.

- Magic Skill Roll = 3d6 (base) + Xd6 (Magic Skill) + Xd6 (Vocation Attributes) + Xd6 (Resource consumed capped by Magic Vocation level) + Xd6 (Conduit Dice Modification)

### Overcharging Magic

When casting magic with additional resource above the level allowed by your Magic Vocation level, the magic can have erratic behavior. Roll a d20 to determine the nature of the behavior.

| d20 | Runecraft Malfunction table                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 7   | The spell's target becomes overwhelmed by a desire to eat the caster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Magic Cantrips

Cantrips are uses of Magic that use an insignificant amount of Resource. In general, Cantrips should be small and happen close to the user. Igniting your fingertips to light a cigar, or creating a gentle breeze are all examples of Cantrips. Cantrips attacks are considered the weakest form of offense, only used in dire situations or for utility.

- Unaffected by Magic assists (as no Magic Resource is consumed)
- Resource Requirement: 0

## Magic Skills in Combat

- -2d6 to ranged combat rolls engaging in melee combat
- Character's can't cast magic twice in one round of combat unless specified otherwise

### Ranges

The Range type for non cantrip ranged attacks changes depending on the user's skill level unless specified otherwise.

| Skill level |  Range Type  |
| :---------: | :----------: |
|     -1     |    Close    |
|      0      |    Short    |
|      1      |    Medium    |

#### Magic Range adjustment

If a Magic Skill has a range adjustment it is either moved up or down the table above. Ranged attacks can not fall below Close Range.

For instance if I have a level 3 Magic skill with a -1 Magic Range adjustment, my magic skill has an Extended Range Type.

### Cone

Represents a character unleashing an attack over an area represented by a cone. The table below shows default cones, with the width of the cone at any point equal to the distance from the user. However, any cone that doesn't exceed effective range or the Cone Area for a specified dice roll is acceptable.

Requires Level 1 in specific Magic skill

- Penetration: 2
- Resource Requirement: 1 minimum
- Engageable Opponents: Cone
- Effective/Max Range: Can not exceed effective range
- Cone Base/Height: Magic Roll * 5 feet

| Magic Roll | Cone Height/Base | Cone Angle |  Cone Area  |
| :--------: | :--------------: | :---------: | :---------: |
|   2 dice   |      10 ft      | ~53 degrees |   50 ft^2   |
|   3 dice   |      15 ft      | ~53 degrees | 112.5 ft^2 |
|   4 dice   |      20 ft      | ~53 degrees |  200 ft^2  |
|   5 dice   |      25 ft      | ~53 degrees | 312.5 ft^2 |
|   6 dice   |      30 ft      | ~53 degrees |  450 ft^2  |
|   7 dice   |      35 ft      | ~53 degrees | 612.5 ft^2 |
|   8 dice   |      40 ft      | ~53 degrees |  800 ft^2  |
|   9 dice   |      45 ft      | ~53 degrees | 1012.5 ft^2 |
|  10 dice  |      50 ft      | ~53 degrees |  1250 ft^2  |
|  11 dice  |      55 ft      | ~53 degrees | 1512.5 ft^2 |
|  12 dice  |      60 ft      | ~53 degrees |  1800 ft^2  |

Here is a handy equation I made for calculating custom Cones. “A” is area, “D” is distance, and theta is the angle closest to the caster. Simply plug in the Area for your dice roll, and either “D” or theta. Whatever you didn’t plugin will be calculated. If none of this makes sense, brush up on your trigonometry or just use the default cones above!
