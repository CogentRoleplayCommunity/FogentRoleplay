![Polycraft](Polycraft.png)

Polycraft users can narratively attempt the following:

- Take on physical monstrous traits
- Attack with monstrous traits
- Modify appearance

Polycraft fundamentally is the ability to enhance, heal, and change one's body. The various races have their own variant of this, leading to unique abilities between them.

#### Absorbing Fellblood: Flesh and Blood

Flesh and blood can be consumed to regain Fellblood. This generally is done ravenously. An extra point of Fellblood should be awarded if a Fellkind of Monster is consumed.

#### Specialization: The Beast

The many monsters of the Continent such as werebeasts, vampires, kikimora, etc... are known for their remarkable strength, speed, and durability. Those that follow this specialization seek to emulate these features in their own bodies.

#### Specialization: The Doppelganger

Doppelgangers are devious shapeshifters that take on the appearance of other humanoids, throwing off pursuit or luring victims to their doom with misdirection and disguise. Common practitioners of this are spies, assassins, thiefs, etcâ€¦ The narrator may give dice bonuses based on the context of the mimicked persona in relation to the creature the user is trying to influence.

#### Slash Resistance

By achieving a CL 3 check, for the cost of 1 Fellblood a character may gain resistance to these damage types equal to the points invested in this Fellcraft. This effect has a duration of 1 hour.
