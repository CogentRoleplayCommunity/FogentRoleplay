Ferracraft users can narratively attempt the following:

- Create and manipulate metals using magnetic waves
- Metal Sense (Vibrations) to assist Perception Checks

#### Specialization: The Metal Dragon

Dragonsteel has legendary properties of strength and durability. Dragons channel their power from the dragonsteel scales that cover their bodies.

##### Dragonsteel

Allows the user to produce dragonsteel from their bodies. In addition, the plant growth the user produces has an odd dark coloring to it. This plant growth has a mind of its own, spreading to everything around it. The raw destructive power is terrifying, as given the right circumstance things can quickly go out of hand.

#### Absorb Ichor: Magnetism

Large amounts of magnetic waves can be used to absorb Ichor. This can be done with near sources of large magnetic energy.

#### Physical Resistance

By achieving a CL 3 check, for the cost of 1 Ichor a character may gain resistance to this element equal to the points invested in this Fellcraft. And for each resistance point gained, gain a weakness level to Electric damage. This effect has a duration of 1 hour.
