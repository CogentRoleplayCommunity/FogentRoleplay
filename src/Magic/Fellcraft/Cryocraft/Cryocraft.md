Cryocraft users can narratively attempt the following:

- Create cold (ice)
- Manipulate cold

#### Specialization: The Ice Dragon

Dragonfire is legendary in its destructive capabilities. Dragons channel their from the elemental scales that cover their bodies.

##### Dragonfrost

Allows the user to dragonfrost from their mouth. In addition, the frost the user produces has an odd dark coloring to it. This frost has a mind of its own, leaching of everything around it through a form of entropy. The raw destructive power is terrifying, as given the right circumstance things can quickly go out of hand.

#### Absorb Fellblood: Cold

Cold can be used to absorb Fellblood. This can be done with blizzards, frigid environments, and large bodies of ice.
