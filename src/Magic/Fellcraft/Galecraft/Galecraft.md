Galecraft craft users can narratively attempt the following:

- Create gales and fog.
- Manipulate gales.
- Attempt to high jump
- Attempt to levitate
- Attempt to fly
- Compress air to create shortwaves

Galecraft generally takes on two forms, derived from the great monstrous birds and Gale Dragons. Those that draw their Galecraft from the great birds such as Phoenix or Thunderbird will grow feathers that can be used to influence the gales, some of these feathers will detach, still under the user's influence. These feathers can act as extensions of the userâ€™s will far from their bodies.

#### Specialization: The Gale Dragon

Dragongale is legendary in its destructive capabilities. Dragons channel their from the elemental scales that cover their bodies.

##### Dragongale

Allows the user to breath dragongale from from their mouth. In addition, the dragongale the user produces has an odd smokey coloring to it. Dragongale has a mind of its own, creating small tornadoes. The raw destructive power is terrifying, as given the right circumstance things can quickly go out of hand.

#### Absorb Fellblood: Gale

Gale can be used to absorb Fellblood. This can be done near storms, tornadoes, places of great height, ect...
