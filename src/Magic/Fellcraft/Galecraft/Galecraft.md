Galecraft craft users can narratively attempt the following:

- Create gales and fog.
- Manipulate gales.
- Attempt to high jump

Galecraft generally takes on two forms, derived from the great monstrous birds and Gale Dragons. Those that draw their Galecraft from the great birds such as Phoenix or Thunderbird will grow feathers that can be used to influence the gales, some of these feathers will detach, still under the user's influence. These feathers can act as extensions of the userâ€™s will far from their bodies.

#### Specialization: The Gale Dragon

##### Dragongale
