Naturecraft users can narratively attempt the following:

- Create plants
- Manipulate plants
- Plant Sense (Vibrations) to assist Perception Checks

#### Specialization: The Nature Dragon

Dragongrowth is legendary in its destructive capabilities. Dragons channel their power from the elemental scales that cover their bodies.

##### Dragongrowth

Allows the user to dragongrowth from their mouth. In addition, the plant growth the user produces has an odd dark coloring to it. This plant growth has a mind of its own, spreading to everything around it. The raw destructive power is terrifying, as given the right circumstance things can quickly go out of hand.

#### Absorb Fellblood: Nature

Large amounts of plant life can be used to absorb Fellblood. This can be done with forests, crop fields, or large gardens.

#### Bludgeon, Pierce, Slash Resistance

By achieving a CL 3 check, for the cost of 1 Fellblood a character may gain resistance to this element equal to the points invested in this Fellcraft. For each resistance point gained, gain a weakness level to Fire damage. This effect has a duration of 1 hour.
