Hemacraft users can narratively attempt the following:

#### Specialization: The Healing Blood

This technique was discovered when Byrgenwerth Scholars found a dark truth deep within the Siren ruins that now lay under Reddwall. Protected fervently by House Reddington and the scholars at Byrgenwerth. Healing blood is shelf stable, has antifungal and antibacterial properties.

#### Absorb Fellblood: Blood

Blood can be consumed to absorb Fellblood. Every time a Hemacraft attack is successfully made, you may regain 1 Fellblood.  An extra point of Fellblood should be awarded if a Fellkind of Monster blood is consumed. The opponent loses 1 Fellblood.
