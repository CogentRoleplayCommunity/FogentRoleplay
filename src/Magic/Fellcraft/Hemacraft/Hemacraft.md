Hemacraft users can narratively attempt the following:

- Create and manipulate blood
- Absorb Fellblood from living hosts
- Blood Sense (Heartbeats) to assist Perception Checks

#### Blood Buffing

When a character attempts a Blood Buff, they make a Hemacraft Roll. Depending on the wins achieved, the user gains that benefit associated with that CL and all the benefits below. If the user attempts to perform another transformation, they must drop their transformed state.

#### Pierce, Slash Resistance

By achieving a CL 3 check, for the cost of 1 Fellblood a character may gain resistance to this element equal to the points invested in this Fellcraft. This effect has a duration of 1 hour. Bleed resistance keeps blood in the body.

#### Specialization: The Healing Blood

This technique was discovered when Byrgenwerth Scholars found a dark truth deep within the Siren ruins that now lay under Reddwall. Protected fervently by House Reddington and the scholars at Byrgenwerth. Healing blood is shelf stable, has antifungal and antibacterial properties.

By performing the following check below, a character may produce enough healing blood for one use of a healing blood vial.
