Blazecraft users can narratively attempt the following:

- Create, manipulate, and extinguish fire, smoke, and ash.
- Resist fire and heat.
- Raise core body heat to resist disease and hypothermia.

Blazecraft is one of the most common Fellcraft learned, owing to its utility and combat effectiveness. It allows the user to create and manipulate fire. While all expressions of Blazecraft come from the same root gene, the most widely taught and used is derived from the Phoenix immolation or Dragonfire.

#### Specialization: The Fire Dragon

Dragonfire is legendary in its destructive capabilities. Dragons channel their from the elemental scales that cover their bodies.

Allows the user to breathe fire from their mouth. In addition, the fire the user produces has an odd dark coloring to it. This fire has a mind of its own, leaping from fuel to fuel. The raw destructive power is terrifying, as given the right circumstance things can quickly go out of hand.

#### Absorbing Fellblood: Fire

Fire and heat can be used to absorb Fellblood. This can be done with large fires, volcanoes, smoldering ash, blazing comets, etc...

#### [Unfinished] Specialization: The Phoenix

Phoenix produce fire via the  immolation of one's own flesh as fuel for the fire, a process similar to the Silverburn reaction. Phoenix solved this issue by evolving ways to channel magic into regenerating flesh as fast as they burn it. This produces an immense amount of heat and flame, though it is quite taxing on the user. That being said this isn't a safe process, and can end up backfiring on new users of this Fellcraft.

#### Fire Resistance

By achieving a CL 3 check, for the cost of 1 Fellblood a character may gain resistance to this element equal to the points invested in this Fellcraft. This effect has a duration of 1 hour.
