Electrocraft craft users can narratively attempt the following:

- Create and manipulate electricity.
- Resist electric damage.
- Use Electrosense (Assist on Perception)

Practitioners of Electrocraft are actually generating electrite, a naturally occurring crystal that has many electrical properties used across Terra in various runecraft inventions. Naturally occurring electrite can be found underground, glowing if it holds a charge. A user's body can use these crystals to convert the Fellblood in one's blood into an electric charge held within the electrite on the user's body. This charge can then be released by the user at will.
A favorite among users of Runecraft, Electrocraft can aid in constructing Runecrafts owing to its ability to charge and influence electrite. The most common forms of Electrocraft are derived from Storm Dragons and Thunderbirds. Those of Darkbeast heritage grow specialized hair imbued with electrite, though this form has mainly been lost throughout the bloodlines.

#### Specialization: The Lightning Dragon

Dragonlightning is legendary in its destructive capabilities. Dragons channel their from the elemental scales that cover their bodies.

##### Dragonlightning

Allows the user to breath dragonlightning from from their mouth. In addition, the lightning the user produces has an odd dark coloring to it. This lightning has a mind of its own, leaping on its own volition. The raw destructive power is terrifying, as given the right circumstance things can quickly go out of hand.

#### Absorb Fellblood: Electricity

Electricity can be used to absorb Fellblood. This can be done with lighting storms, electrite containing electricity, etc...
