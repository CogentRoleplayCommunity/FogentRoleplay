# Ranged Cantrip

A short ranged minor spell, which has such a small effect it requires no magic resource. This level of proficiency with magic might be a fun party trick or for convenience but has no awe inspiring use. For Fire Magic, this could be used to light a candle across a room. For Water Magic, this could be useful for levitating you ale into your mouth. For Soul Magic, this could be used to see if there are any spirits right next to you. Creativity is encouraged!

Use of ranged cantrips in combat is genrally only reserved for dealing with minor threats to save magic resource or as a desperate last resort after all magic resources are depleted.
