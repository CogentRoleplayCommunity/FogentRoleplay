# Wounding Words

You hurl a barrage of scathing remarks, imbued with arcane nuances, at a creature you can perceive within your vicinity. The target, provided it's capable of hearing your words, though not necessarily comprehending them. If any wins are achieved over the target it takes a Minor Psychic Injury, and the creature has a slight disadvantage (-1d6) on its next attack roll until the conclusion of its following turn.
