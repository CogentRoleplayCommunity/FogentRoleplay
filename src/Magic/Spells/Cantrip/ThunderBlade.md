# Thunder Blade

With the weapon utilized in the casting of the spell held, you infuse it with resonating energy as part of your combat roll. Should the attack connect, the target is subjected to the standard effects of the weapon attack and is subsequently enveloped in resonating energy until your next turn commences. If before the start of your next turn, a effected target willingly moves, it incurs a Minor Injury unaffected by physical armor from Shockwave damage determined below, thus terminating the spell.

At higher dice pool sizes, when the weapon attack lands, resonating energy is released. Resulting in additional combat roll dice as part of the weapon attack.
