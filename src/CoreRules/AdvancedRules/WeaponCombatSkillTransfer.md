## Weapon Combat Skill Transfer

### Melee Weapon Combat Skill Transfer

For melee weapons, weapon reach, footwork, and the biomechanics of swinging a weapon have some overlap between weapon skills. The below table show how a given skill with a particular weapon class gains skills, though lesser, in similar weapons class in regards to size and function.

You cannot go below 0 on a combat skill for either melee or ranged weapons via the table below.

Starting on with the weapon skill your character currently possesses, each horizontal (right and left on the table) or vertical (up and down on the table) jump is -1 reduction to the skill you've moved to. When moving horizontally within a Size type, you may access the other side of the table as if it were right beside it.

| Class<br />/Size | Hafted         | Blade        | Spear       |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Small            | Small Hafted   | Small Blade |             |
| Medium           | Medium Hafted | Medium Sword | Medium Spear |
| Large            | Large Hafted  | Large Sword | Spear       |
| Reach            | Reach Hafted  | Greatsword   | Longspear   |

### Bow Combat Skill Transfer

For bows and crossbows, having a proper base, judging the distance, leading your targets,  aiming and releasing the projectile smoothly are examples of the overlap. However, bows are significantly harder to use than crossbows.

Each right jump (bows to crossbows) or vertical jump (up and down on the table) is -1 reduction to the skill you've moved to. Each left jump (crossbows to bows) is a -2 reduction to the skill you've moved to.

| Class<br />/Size | Bows      | Crossbows      |
| ---------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| Hand             |           | Hand Crossbow  |
| Light            | Light Bow | Light Crossbow |
| Heavy            | Heavy Bow | Heavy Crossbow |

### Respecing Combat Skills

Since certain weapon sizes provide more combat skill transfer than others, it is intend for the narrator to allow rebalancing skill point investments as to not waste skill levels as long as all previously know skills maintain they're skill level.

For example, a character has just been given a skill point to spend and has a level 3 in Small blade. They wish to invest their skill point into Medium sword to try a new magic sword they found. Since they have a 3 in Small Blade already, by the weapon combat skill transfer rules they have a level 2 in Medium Sword. If they were to invest their skill point into Medium Sword to bring it to level 3, they are technically wasting skill points as had they from the start only invested the 3 skill points from Small Blade into Medium sword, with the addition of the unspent skill point, they'd have a level 4 in Medium sword, which would also give them a level 3 in Small Blade. Instead of wasting skill points, they can take the 3 skill points from Small Blade and the 1 unspent skill point and spend it on bring Medium sword to level 4. Since having a level 4 in Medium Sword gives a level 3 in Small Blade, nothing has changed in Small Blade.
