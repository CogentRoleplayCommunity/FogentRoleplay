# Item Classes

Item class differentiates items that have an inherent mechanical utility, such as weapons, armor, containers, etc..., from those that just have narrative/monetary significance such as rations, a fancy hat, ect... This does not include magical effects or additional effects not inherent to the items, for those see Item Effects.
