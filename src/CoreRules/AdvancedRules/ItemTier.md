# Item Tier

Items come in various tiers of quality. Depending on an item's tiers, it will have the following stats associated with it.

## Base Dice

Base dice are always represented by 3 dice, however depending on an item's tier, which type of 3 dice can change. For instance, a mundane dagger has base dice of 3d6 for a combat roll. With a Mythic dagger, the base dice would be 2d20 and 1d12.

Item Tier also applies to Magic Conduits, tools used in skill rolls (high-quality grappling hook for Climb), and is meant to apply both in and out of combat. Some items will rarely use their base dice like armor, instead benefiting more from other stats on the table such as durability.

## Item Durability (Optional)

Using item durability is a great way to increase immersion (such as having to go to a blacksmith or learn to repair their gear) and challenge your players. However, for players who want a more casual experience, item durability can be disregarded.

### Weapon Durability

A weapon's Durability decreases by 1 whenever a weapon is used to attempt to inflict an injury level.

### Magic Conduit Durability

A magic conduit's durability decreases by 1 whenever it is used to cast magic the consumes magic resource.

### Armor Durability

If an injury is fully negated by armor, then the defender can decide which pieces of armor take armor damage. The armor must sum up to the defense level required to prevent the incoming injury and all take the same amount of armor damage. An armor's durability decreases by the level of injury inflicted plus the attack's defense penetration.

- Armor damage = (level of injury inflicted) + (combat roll penetration)

If an injury is not fully negated by the defender's armor, then all pieces of armor take armor damage.

### Normal Play Durability Rules

When an item's durability falls, its base dice remain unchanged until the weapon reaches 6 durability (or Damaged) at which point you begin using the base dice associated with your current durability. For instance, if my weapon has 5 durability, then I roll with the base dice associated with Compromised.

### Hardcore Durability Rules

When an item's durability falls, each time your item's durability falls to the lower tier's max durability, you then use that lower tier's base dice. For instance, if I had a legendary tier sword with 23 durability I would be rolling the Superior tier base dice.
