# Carry Weight and Weight Classes

## Carry Weight

Carry Weight represents a character's ability to carry heavier equipment while still being able to move semi-normally depending on weight class.

For each dice in a character's Lift dice pool the character gains 50 lbs of Carry Weight. Any dice penalty on the Lift dice pool from the characters Weight Class is disregarded for this calculation.

## Weight Classes

Effects that represent the physical strain of carrying equipment. Some characters will purposefully be in a higher weight class to gain the benefits of heavier armor and weapons, making up for their Carry weight penalty with better gear.
