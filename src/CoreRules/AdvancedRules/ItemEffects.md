# Items Effects

Effects can be put on items that augment them or add new buffs/debuffs. In a fantasy setting, these could be magical enchantments. In a modern setting, these could be attachments to a rifle. In order to put an effect on an item, the item must satisfy the item tier requirement for that effect. For instance, it would be impossible to put a legendary enchantment effect onto a broken dagger.

You can put multiple effects on a single item, within reason. For instance, putting a fire and ice enchantment on a sword would sort of be ridiculous. Or in a modern setting, you couldn't put two scopes on your rifle, unless you had a canted sight attachment. Players will be restrained by the associated cost and rarity of said effects. Narrators should be cautious about throwing to many effects on an item unless that is the point.

If you have two different effects active that buff or debuff some feature of your character, these do not stack unless otherwise stated.
