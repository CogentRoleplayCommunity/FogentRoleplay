## Item Durability (Optional)

Using item durability is a great way to increase immersion (having to go to blacksmith or learn to repair their gear) and challenge for your players. However, for players that want a more casual experience, item durability can be disregarded.

### Weapon Durability

A weapon's Durability decreases by 1 whenever a weapon is used to attempt to inflict an injury level.

### Conduit Durability

A conduit's durability decreases by 1 whenever it is used to cast magic with a resource ( non-cantrip casting )

### Armor Durability

If an injury is fully negated by armor, then the defender can decide which pieces of armor take armor damage. The armor/armors must sum up to the defense level required to prevent the incoming injury and all take the same amount of armor damage.

An armors durability decreases by level of injury inflicted plus the attacks defense penetration.

- Armor damage = (level of injury inflicted) + (attack's armor penetration)

If an injury is not fully negated by the defender's armor, then all pieces of armor take armor damage.

### Normal Play Durability Rules

When an item's durability falls, it's base dice remain unchanged until the weapon reaches 9 durability (or Shoddy) at which point you begin using the base dice associated with your current durability. For instance, if my weapon has 5 durability, then I roll with the base dice associated with Compromised.

### Hardcore Durability Rules

When an item's durability falls, each time your item's durability falls to lower tier's max durability, you then use that lower tier's base dice. For instance, if I had a legendary tier sword with 23 durability I would be rolling the Superior tier base dice.
