# Carry Weight

Carry weight represents a character's ability to haul weight while still being able to move semi-normal depending on weight class.

For each dice in a character's Lift dice pool, character gains 50 lbs of Carry Weight. Dice Penalties from Weight Classes are disregarded.

| Carry Weight | +50 lbs Carry Weight per Lift dice |

## Weight Classes

Weight Classes represent the physical strain of carrying equipment. Some characters will purposefully be in a higher weight class to gain the benefits of heavier armor and weapons, making up for their Carry weight penalty with better gear.
