# Carry Weight

Carry weight represents a character's ability to haul weight while still being able to move semi-normal depending on weight class.

## Weight Classes

Weight Classes represent the effects of carrying equipment and gear. Some characters will purposefully be in a higher weight class to gain the benefits of heavier armor and weapons, making up for their Carry weight penalty with better gear.
