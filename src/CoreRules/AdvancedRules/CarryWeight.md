# Carry Weight

Carry weight represents a character's ability to haul weight while still being able to move semi-normal depending on weight class.

For each point dice in a character's Lift dice pool, character gains 50 lbs of Carry Weight.

| Description |            Calculation            |
| :----------: | :--------------------------------: |
| Carry Weight | +50 lbs Carry Weight per Lift dice |

## Weight Classes

Weight Classes represent the effects of carrying equipment and gear. Some characters will purposefully be in a higher weight class to gain the benefits of heavier armor and weapons, making up for their Carry weight penalty with better gear.

|   Description   |               Effect               |             Source             |
| :-------------: | :---------------------------------: | :----------------------------: |
|  Light Weight  | -0d6 to STR/RFX governed Dice Pools | 0% =< Equipment Weight <=Â 25% |
|  Medium Weight  | -1d6 to STR/RFX governed Dice Pools | 25% < Equipment Weight <= 50% |
|  Heavy Weight  | -2d6 to STR/RFX governed Dice Pools | 50% < Equipment Weight <= 100% |
| Over-encumbered | -4d6 to STR/RFX governed Dice Pools |    100% < Equipment Weight    |

## Containers

Pouches, satchel, sacks, backpacks, chest, etc... are all consider containers. Each container can hold a certain amount of weight and/or volume within.

### Containers in Combat

Characters will often stash or drop containers during combat as to not be in a heavier Weight Class. This is perfectly acceptable, but it is within the Narrators right to treat these items as fair game to be swipped by the enemy if an oppurtunity arises, however this might effect their Weight Class aswell. Character's wishing to avoid a having their loot stolen can keep it on their backs, by a mount to stash it on, increase their carry weight, etc...
