# Containers

Pouches, satchel, sacks, backpacks, chest, etc... are all consider containers. Each container can hold a certain amount of weight and/or volume within.

## Container Classes

|       Name       | Weight Capacity (lbs) |
| :--------------: | :-------------------: |
| 300 lb container |          300          |
| 50 lb container |          50          |
| 35 lb container |          35          |
| 30 lb container |          30          |
| 12 lb container |          12          |
|  6 lb container  |           6           |

## Containers in Combat

Characters will often stash or drop containers during combat as to not be in a heavier Weight Class. This is perfectly acceptable, but it is within the Narrators right to treat these items as fair game to be swiped by the enemy if an opportunity arises, however this might effect their Weight Class as well. Character's wishing to avoid a having their loot stolen can keep it on their backs, by a mount to stash it on, increase their equipment weight, etc...

## Container Example from Fallen

When representing a container on a character sheet, a similar table as the one below is used. For Containers, whatever the first item in the list is marks it as what kind of container it is.
