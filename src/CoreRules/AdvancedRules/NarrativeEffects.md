# Narrative Effects

Narrative Effects covers a broad range of narratively significant effects. They are deliberately left open ended to be able to do anything, with the understanding that if an Effect can be describe by one of the other more specific Effect types, it should. For instance, if a Narrator was trying to give a monster natural armor to represent it's thick hide, they should use the Defense Effect instead of a Narrative Effect.
