# Effects

Effects can be applied to either characters or items, adding buffs/debuffs, weapons, defenses, narrative considerations, injuries, status effects, etc... In a fantasy setting, these could be magical enchantments. In a modern setting, these could be attachments to a rifle.

If you have two different effects active that buff or debuff some feature of your character, these do not stack unless otherwise stated.

The two large categories are "Character Sheet Effects" and "Narrative Effects".

## Character Sheet Effects

"Character Sheet Effects" can essentially be thought of as effects that change something on your character sheet. For instance, if a character gains a Weapon, then they would also gain a new combat roll. If a character gained an Injury, then they'd have to recalculate many of there dice pools with the penalties from the Injuries.

### Attribute Dice Mod

Adds or subtracts dice for dice pools if they governed by at least one of the Attributes specified.

- [Injury](./../CombatRules/InjuryAndHealing.md#injury)
- [Weight Classes](./../AdvancedRules/EquipmentCarryWeightAndWeightClasses.md#weight-classes)

### Attribute Level Adjustment

For a specified Attribute, a Character receives an adjustment to it's level. The resulting level can not go outside the upper and lower bounds for a Attribute.

| Name         | Desc             | Duration   | Source |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Enhanced STR | +1 to STR level. | Indefinite |        |

### Defense

See [Defense](./src/CoreRules/CombatRules/Defense.md) for more information.

### Set Attribute Level

Sets a specified Attribute of a character to a new value. If the character's innate Attribute is greater than or equal to the new value, no change occurs.

| Name           | Effect                   | Duration   | Source |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ---------- | ------ |
| Super Strength | Strength set to level 4. | Indefinite |        |
| Super Reflex   | Reflex set to level 4.   | Indefinite |        |

### Set Skill Level

Sets a specified Skill/Vocation of a character to a new value. If the character's innate Skill/Vocation is greater than or equal to the new value, no change occurs.

| Name             | Effect                     | Duration   | Source |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Super Perception | Perception set to level 5. | Indefinite |        |

### Skill Base Dice Tier

Sets the base dice of specific skills or vocations dice pools.

For instance, if a Mundane Fire Magic Spellcasting Focus is used, all uses of the Fire Magic Skill have 3d6. With a Excellent Fire Magic Spellcasting Focus, all uses of the Fire magic Skill have 3d8 instead. Base Dice Tiers also apply to tools/gear used in skill rolls (high-quality climbing equipment for use with Athletics), and is meant to apply both in and out of combat.

## Narrative Effects

"Narrative Effects" can essentially be thought of as effects that do not change anything on a character sheet when added.

For instance, a Size Effect doesn't change anything else on your sheet when added, though it could have a massive impact on how a character is played. A potion with a Healing Effect doesn't have any mechanical effect until a player uses it within narrative.

|                Defense Spells                | The staff is endowed with 10 charges, serving as the fuel for the enclosed spells. When holding the staff, you can use your action to cast one of the following spells from it, provided you have a vocation that can unlock the magic required for these spells: Physical Protection (1 charge) or Mage Shield (2 charges). No components are necessary. At the break of dawn, the staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges. Should the staff exhaust its charges entirely, roll a d20. If the result is 1, the staff shatters and meets its destruction. | While Equipped |         (Item Name)         |

Spending a "Preemptive Destiny Point" before rolling a dice pool gives Advantage on the resulting roll. Spending "Post Roll Destiny Points" adds additional Wins for each point spent, with the total Wins never exceeding the size of the dice pool.                                                                                                         |                | 0/3 (Given by The Narrator) |
