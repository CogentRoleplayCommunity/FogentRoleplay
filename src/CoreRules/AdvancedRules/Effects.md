# Effects

Effects can be applied to either characters or items, adding new buffs/debuffs, weapons, defenses, narrative considerations, injuries, etc... In a fantasy setting, these could be magical enchantments. In a modern setting, these could be attachments to a rifle.

The two large categories are "Character Sheet Effects" and "Narrative Effects".

## Character Sheet Effects

"Character Sheet Effects" can essentially be thought of as effects that change something on your character sheet.

For instance, if a character gains a Weapon, then they would also gain a new combat roll. If a character gained an Injury, then they'd have to recalculate many of there dice pools with the penalties from the Injuries.

If you have two different character sheet effects active that buff or debuff some feature of your character, these do not stack unless otherwise stated.

## Narrative Effects

"Narrative Effects" can essentially be thought of as effects that do not change anything on a character sheet when added.

For instance, a Disabling Characteristic doesn't change anything else on your sheet when added, though it could have a massive impact on how a character is played. A potion with a Healing doesn't have any mechanical effect until a player uses it within narrative. 

- [Disabling Characteristics](./src/CoreRules/CharacterCreationRules/DisablingCharacteristics.md)
- [Healing](./src/CoreRules/AdvancedRules/Healing.md)
- [Destiny Points](./src/CoreRules/GeneralRules/DestinyPoints.md)

Narrative Effects covers a broad range of narratively significant effects. They are deliberately left open ended to be able to do anything, with the understanding that if an Effect can be describe by one of the other more specific Effect types, it should. For instance, if a Narrator was trying to give a monster natural armor to represent it's thick hide, they should use the Defense Effect instead of a Narrative Effect.
