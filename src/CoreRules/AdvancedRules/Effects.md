# Items Effects

Effects can be applied to either characters or items, adding new buffs/debuffs, weapons, defenses, narrative considerations, etc...

In a fantasy setting, these could be magical enchantments. In a modern setting, these could be attachments to a rifle.

You can put multiple effects on a single item or character. For instance, putting a fire and ice enchantment on a sword would sort of be ridiculous. Or in a modern setting, you couldn't put two scopes on your rifle, unless you had a canted sight attachment.

Narrators should be cautious about throwing to many effects on an item unless that is the point.

If you have two different effects active that buff or debuff some feature of your character, these do not stack unless otherwise stated.
