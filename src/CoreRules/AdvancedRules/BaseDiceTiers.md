# Base Dice Tiers

Base dice are always represented by 3 dice, however depending on a Base Dice Tier, which type of 3 dice can change for better or worse. For instance, a mundane dagger has base dice of 3d6 for a combat roll. With a Mythic dagger, the base dice would be 2d20 and 1d12.

Base Dice Tiers also applies to Magic Conduits, tools used in skill rolls (high-quality climbing equipment for use with Athletics), and is meant to apply both in and out of combat.
