# Vision and Light

The ability of a character to see is crucial for various tasks. These tasks include identifying threats, locating hidden items, attacking enemies, and directing spells, among others. A character's visibility can be significantly impaired by darkness or any other factors that obscure vision.

## Vision Obscurement

There are different levels of obscurity that a given area can have, ranging from light to heavy.

### Unobscured

An area is considered unobscured if it does not impede a character's vision. In such areas, characters roll normal Perception checks that rely on sight.

### Lightly Obscured

An area is considered lightly obscured if it has dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage. In such areas, creatures face a Disadvantage to Perception checks that rely on sight.

### Heavily Obscured

An area is heavily obscured when it has darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage. In these areas, vision is entirely blocked. Any creature trying to see something in a heavily obscured area is effectively blinded.

## Light

The illumination of an environment is categorized into three types: bright light, dim light, and darkness.

### Bright Light (Unobscured)

Most creatures, including humans, can see normally in bright light. This light can come from various sources such as torches, lanterns, fires, or even gloomy days, and it illuminates within a specific radius.

### Dim Light (Lightly Obscured)

Also referred to as shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. This area is typically a boundary between a source of bright light, like a torch, and the surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn, or even a particularly brilliant full moon, also counts as dim light.

### Darkness (Heavily Obscured)

Darkness, on the other hand, creates a heavily obscured area. Characters encounter darkness outdoors at night (excluding moonlight nights), inside an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.

## Vision Types

### Darkvision

A special ability that many creatures in fantasy realms, particularly those that live underground, possess. This ability allows a creature to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and see in darkness as if it were dim light up to a certain distance. However, the trade-off is that they can't distinguish colors in the dark, only different shades of gray.

### Blindsight

Blindsight allows a creature to perceive its environment without the need for sight, within a certain range. It's typically found in creatures that lack eyes, such as oozes, or in those that have heightened senses or use echolocation, like bats and true dragons. These creatures can sense their surroundings regardless of visual obstructions or conditions.

### Truesight

Within a designated range can see in regular and magical darkness, observe invisible entities and objects, effortlessly discern visual illusions, succeed on skill checks against them, and discern the true form of a shapechanger or a creature altered by magic. Additionally, can be used to see into the Ethereal Plane.
