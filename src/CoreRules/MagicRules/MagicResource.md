### Regaining Magic Resource

Detailed below are various ways a character could regain magic resource. The amount of Short Rests and Absorbing Magic Resource tasks performed can not exceed your Vocation Level, resetting on long rests.

#### Short Resting

Depending on your magic system, maintaining one's physical health can restore Magic Resource over time. A short rest takes roughly 1 hour where the character does nothing demanding. Durning this time they can tend to wounds, eat, drink, or relax. Characters can regain Magic Resource equal to the wins from their Governing Core Skill roll (remember you can assist with your Magic Vocation). If negative or zero, none is regained.

#### Absorbing Magic Resource

Depending on your magic system, Magic users can absorb and feed on an ample source of primal elements/magic/power to regain Magic Resource using a Magic skill. Characters can regain Magic Resource equal to the wins from their Magic Skill roll (remember you can assist with your Magic Vocation). If negative or zero, none is regained. Absorbing or meditating near a large source of the elements/magic/power are acceptable. Flavor and creativity are encouraged.

#### Long Resting

This can be done by maintaining adequate nutrition, hydration, sleep, and stress levels. A long rest of roughly 8 hours of downtime. Durning this downtime, at least 6 hours must be devoted to sleep. While being awake for no more than 2 hours of a long rest, characters can treat wounds, eat, drink, relax, and stand watch.
