### Resting for Magic Resource

Depending on your magic system, maintaining one's physical health can restore Magic Resource over time.

#### Short Resting

A short rest takes roughly 1 hour where the character does nothing demanding. Durning this time they can tend to wounds, eat, drink, or relax.

Once per day, characters can regain Magic Resource equal to the wins from their Governing Core Skill roll (remember you can assist with your Magic Vocation).

#### Long Resting

This can be done by maintaining adequate nutrition, hydration, sleep, and stress levels. A long rest of roughly 8 hours of downtime. Durning this downtime, at least 6 hours must be devoted to sleep. While being awake for no more than 2 hours of a long rest, characters can treat wounds, eat, drink, relax, and stand watch.

### Absorbing Magic Resource

Depending on your magic system, Magic users can absorb and feed on an ample source of primal elements/magic/power to regain Magic Resource using a Magic skill. This ability can be used once per day for each Magic Vocation point, resetting on long rests. The magic skill used dictates how much Magic Resource is regained determined by your skill level. If negative or zero, none is regained. Absorbing or meditating near a large source of the elements/magic/power are acceptable. Flavor and creativity are encouraged.
