# Magic Systems

Fogent Roleplay provides generalized framework for magic system mechanics for any setting. Whether it be the Force from Star Wars, Bending from Avatar, Cyberpunk technomancy, or tractional fantasy magic, this system should easily accommodate.

All magic systems built using this generalized framwork require the following pieces of information to be determined. If you can come up with these, then you have a magic system!

- Magic Name
- Magic Vocation Name
- Magic Vocation Governing Attributes
- Magic Resource Name
- Magic Governing Core Skill
- Magic Skill List
- Cantrip Name (Optional)

Fallen (the setting) has 3 premade magic systems as a reference:

- [Fellcraft](./../../Settings/Fallen/Magic/Fellcraft/Fellcraft.md)
- [Runecraft](./../../Settings/Fallen/Magic/Runecraft/Runecraft.md)
- [Miracles](./../../Settings/Fallen/Magic/Miracles/Miracles.md)

## Magic Name

This is the name of the Magic in setting. (Wizardry, Sorcery, Druidic magic, Pact Magic)

## Magic Vocation Name

This is the name in setting for the Vocation. (Wizard, Sorcerer, Druid, Warlock)

## Magic Vocation Governing Attributes

Different Magic Vocations rely on different attributes.

Most traditional fantasy Magic Vocations have RFX and INT as their Magic Governing Attributes, as most magic benefits for quicker casting times and more knowledge. However, Magic Vocations that narratively rely on a characters physical body, such as Dragon fire or genetic bloodline magic, might also include STR as on of its Magic Vocation Governing Attributes.

## Magic Resource Name

Determining what fuel the use of Magic Skill that fall under a Magic Vocation is crucial. Is it the will of the caster, their connection with nature, their connection to a divine entity?

## Magic Governing Core Skill

A Magic Governing Core Skill is a Core Skill that is associated with a Magic Vocation. Used for instances when a character over-exerts themselves with their Magic Skill from their Magic Vocation, is trying to regain Magic Resource, or maintaining concentration on an already cast spell.

Examples of Magic Governing Core Skills:

* Magic that relies on the body to produce Magic Resource uses Endurance. (Bodily Magic)
* Magic that relies on the mind, will, or spirit to produce Magic Resources uses Will. (Wizard Magic)
* Magic that relies upon a belief in a divine higher power might use Will. (Cleric Magic)
* Magic that relies upon a relationship with a divine being or a pact with a nefarious entity could use Communication, as it is only through the connection to the entity that the magic is held together. (Warlock Magic)
* Magic that relies upon one's connection with nature could use Survival. (Druidic Magic)

## Magic Skills

A Magic Vocation should contain a list of the Magic Skills that fall under it's umbrella. See [Magic Skills](./MagicSkills.md) for more information on how to create a Magic Skill list.

## Cantrip Name (Optional)

For a bit of extra flare, determine a new name for Cantrips (or Novice Magic) can make a Magic Vocation feel more unique.
