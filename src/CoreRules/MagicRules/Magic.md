# Magic

This document provides generalized framework for magic system mechanics for any setting. Whether it be the Force, Bending from Avatar, Cyberpunk technomancy, or tractional fantasy magic, this systems should easily accommodate. All magic systems built using this require the following pieces of information to be determined.

- Magic Name
- Magic Vocation Name
- Magic Vocation Governing Attributes
- Magic Resource Name
- Cantrip Name
- Governing Core Skill

## Magic Skills

These magic skills represent generic types of magic representing different concepts. Skill in one of these represents the ability to manipulate and control the concept.

If you are making a magic system, these will probably have different names in your system. This is not an exhaustive list, feel free to add your own.

- Bodily Magic (Flesh, Web, Bone, ect...)
- Heat Magic
- Water Magic
- Electricity Magic
- Earth Magic
- Air Magic
- Cold Magic
- Plant Magic
- Poison Magic
- Soul Magic
- Light Magic
- Shadow Magic
- Mind Magic
- Metal Magic
- Sound Magic
- Blood Magic
- Acid Magic
- Time Magic
- Space Magic
- Gravity Magic

### Combo Magic Skill

Another avenue to explore are magic how these magics could be combined.

- Plasma Magic = Heat Magic + Air Magic
- Storm Magic = Air Magic + Electricity Magic + Water Magic
- Magma Magic = Earth Magic + Heat Magic
- Blizzard Magic = Cold Magic + Air Magic

## Unlocking Magic

You unlock an amount of Magic Skill depending on your Magic Vocation level. All magic skills start at the level -1 (incompetent).

### Party Trick Tier (Level -1: Incompetent)

Requires an investment of 0 skill point to unlock. Generally acquired during character creation or through narrative means. Examples include:

* A minuet latent genetic potential, such as from the race of the character. (Sorcerer)
* Partial knowledge of a type of magic learned quickly on the fly without the required study to be considered a novice. (Wizard)
* A minuet blessing bestowed by a deity. (Cleric)
* A taste of power from an entity looking to make a deal... (Warlock)
* A part of nature foreign to your place of origin. (Druid)

This level of proficiency with magic might be a fun party trick or for convenience but has no awe inspiring use. Those with this level are objectively bad at using this skill. A fire magic skill would allow you to ignite your finger tips to light a cigar, though you could just use a match, flint and steel, or a lighter. You could throw hot smoke at someones face, though you could just punch them in the face instead for similar if not better results.

| Magic Vocation Level | Magic Vocational Skills known |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 0                    | 1                             |
| 1                    | 3                             |
| 2                    | 5                             |
| 3                    | 7                             |
| 4                    | 9                             |

## Governing Core Skill

A governing core skill is used for instances when a character over exerts themselves with their magic too far, is trying to rapidly regain Magic Resource, or maintain a concentration on already cast magic.

* Magic that rely on the body to produce Magic Resource (such as Fallen's Fellcraft) use Endurance as their governing core skill.
* Magic that relies on the mind or spirit to produce Magic Resource (such as Fallen's Runecraft or Miracles) use Will as their governing core skill.
* Magic that relies upon a belief in a divine higher power might use Will as their governing core skill.
* Magic that relies upon a relationship with a divine being or a pact with a nefarious entity could use Communication, as it is only through the connection to the entity that the magic is held together.
* Magic that relies upon ones connection with nature could use Survival.

### Magic Concentration

Certain magic demand your concentration to keep their effects active. If you lose this concentration, the spell's magic ends.

If a spell necessitates concentration, the Duration entry of the spell will indicate this, and it will specify how long you can concentrate on it. You can stop concentrating at any time.

Regular activities, like moving or attacking, don't disturb your concentration. However, the following factors can disrupt your concentration:

* Casting another spell that requires concentration. If you cast a spell that needs concentration while you're focusing on a different spell, you lose concentration on the first spell. You can't concentrate on two spells simultaneously.
* Suffering damage. If you take damage while focusing on a spell, you must make a governing core skill roll to maintain your concentration. The challenge level is equal to the level of injury taken. If you take damage from multiple sources, you make a separate saving throw for each injury source.
* Becoming incapacitated or dying. If you're incapacitated or die, you lose concentration on a spell.
* The Narrator might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave washing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a Challenge level 2 governing core skill check.
