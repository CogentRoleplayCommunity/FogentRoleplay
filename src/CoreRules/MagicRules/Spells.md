# Spells

Spells are very specific ways a character can use their magic. You should really think about these as cool ways someone has figured out they to use their type of magic.

Each spell has magic skill requirements in order to perform. You must satisfy these requirements in order to perform the spell.

## Concentration

Certain Spells demand your concentration to keep their effects active. If you lose this concentration, the Spell's magic ends.

If a Spell necessitates concentration, the Duration entry of the spell will indicate this, and it will specify how long you can concentrate on it. You can stop concentrating at any time.

Regular activities, like moving or attacking, don't disturb your concentration. However, the following factors can disrupt your concentration:

* Casting another spell that requires concentration. If you cast a spell that needs concentration while you're focusing on a different spell, you lose concentration on the first spell. You can't concentrate on two spells simultaneously.
* Suffering damage. If you take damage while focusing on a spell, you must make a Magic Governing Core Skill check to maintain your concentration. The challenge level is equal to the level of injury taken. If you take damage from multiple sources, you make a separate saving throw for each injury source.
* Becoming incapacitated or dying. If you're incapacitated or die, you lose concentration on a spell.
* The Narrator might also decide that certain environmental phenomena. For example, a wave washing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship, the character to succeed on a Challenge level 2 governing core skill check.
