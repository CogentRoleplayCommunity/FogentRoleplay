# Spells

Spells are ways a character can use their Magic Skills. Think about these as cool ways someone has figured out they to use Fogent Magic System.

Spells require certain Magic Skills to perform, a CL required to cast, and an amount of Magic Resource consumed proportionate to the required CL level.

## Concentration

Certain Spells demand a character's concentration to keep their effects active. If this concentration is interrupted, the Spell's magic ends.

If a Spell necessitates concentration, the Duration entry of the spell will indicate this, and it will specify how long you can concentrate on it. You can stop concentrating at any time.

Regular activities, like moving or attacking, don't disturb your concentration. However, the following factors can disrupt your concentration:

* Casting another spell that requires concentration. If you cast a spell that needs concentration while you're focusing on a different spell, you lose concentration on the first spell. You can't concentrate on two spells simultaneously.
* Suffering damage. If you take damage while focusing on a spell, you must make a Magic Governing Core Skill check to maintain your concentration. The challenge level is equal to the level of injury taken. If you take damage from multiple sources, you make a separate saving throw for each injury source.
* Becoming incapacitated or dying. If you're incapacitated or die, you lose concentration on a spell.
* The Narrator might also decide that certain environmental phenomena might require the concentrating character to succeed on a Governing Core Skill check to maintain concentration. For example, a wave washing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship might require a CL 2 Governing Core Skill Check.

## Spells In Combat

If a character intends to use Spells during a combat round, on the declaration phase once they've declared they are going to use magic, they can roll their Magic Skill Roll. Wins achieved dictate the CL achievable that round. The character may also achieve any lower-level outcome.

- A character can cast 1 spell per round that uses Magic Resource.
- A character can cast 1 spell per round that does not use Magic Resource.
- A character can only cast 1 spell per turn as part of their combat roll.

## Generic Spells

Generic Spells can be used for creative purposes and are intended to allow/encourage players to try creative solutions. These spell are only limited by the character's stats, the player's creativity, and the narrator's supervision.

The hologram will also dissipate if you choose to dismiss it as an action or if you cast the spell again. If you choose to create an image of an object, such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest, it cannot exceed a 5 foot cube. When physically interacted with, the hologram is exposed as such because objects and beings can pass through it without obstruction. If a creature dedicates its action to scrutinizing the image, it may discern that it is an hologram by succeeding in a General Knowledge check against the wins from the Magic Skill roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The sound will also dissipate if you choose to dismiss it as an action or if you cast the spell again. You have control over its volume, which can vary from a mere whisper to a thunderous scream. It could resemble your own voice, another person's voice, the mighty roar of a lion, the rhythmic beat of drums, or any other sound you desire. The chosen sound will persist continuously throughout the spell's duration or you can produce discrete sounds at different moments before the spell concludes. If a creature dedicates its action to scrutinizing the sound, it may discern that it is an illusion by succeding a General Knowledge check against the wins from the Magic Skill roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

It must be within the effective range of the spell and it persists for the spell's duration. The illusion will also dissipate if you choose to dismiss it as an action or if you cast the spell again. When you opt for a sound, you have control over its volume, which can vary from a mere whisper to a thunderous scream. It could resemble your own voice, another person's voice, the mighty roar of a lion, the rhythmic beat of drums, or any other sound you desire. The chosen sound will persist continuously throughout the spell's duration, or you can produce discrete sounds at different moments before the spell concludes. If you choose to create an image of an object, such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest, it cannot exceed a 5 foot cube. This illusory image lacks the ability to produce sound, light, scent, or any other sensory effects. When physically interacted with, the illusion is exposed as such because objects and beings can pass through it without obstruction. If a creature dedicates its action to scrutinizing the sound or image, it may discern that it is an illusion by succeeding in an Will check against the wins from the Magic Skill roll. If a creature successfully identifies the illusion, it becomes faint and transparent to that creature. |

Throughout the spell's duration, the object emits bright light in a 20-foot radius, accompanied by dim light for an additional 20 feet. You have the freedom to choose the color of the light. Should the object be fully covered with an opaque material, the emitted light is blocked. The spell concludes if cast anew or dismissed through an action. In the event that you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed in a Dodge roll or Combat Roll to evade the effects of the spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

This apparition persists for the spell's duration or until you choose to dismiss it. The hand dissipates if it strays beyond a the spells effective range or if you cast the spell anew. You have the ability command the hand. Its functions include manipulating objects, opening unlocked doors or containers, stowing or retrieving items from open containers, and pouring the contents out of a vial. The hand's movement speed is equal to it's effective range. It is roughly as strong as the users hand. If attacks are made with it, treat it as the users own unarmed attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
