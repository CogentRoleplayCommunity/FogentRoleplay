# Spells

Spells are ways a character can use their Magic Skills.

To use a Spell a character must:

- Have the appropriate Magic Skills to perform said Spell.
- Achieve the CL required to cast said Spell with their Magic Skill Roll.
- Have Magic Resource to consume proportionate to the Spell's CL.

Some spells can consume additional Magic Resource for improved effects.

## Spells in Narrative

### The Need For Reasonable Constraints

Stories/Narratives are at there very core about some conflict. Everyone loves well thought our magic systems because they add interesting ways to resolve conflicts within a story. Whether it be the Force from Star Wars, Bending from Avatar, or Wizardry from the Dresden Files, "magic" in each setting gives the heros and villains new ways to interact with the conflict of the story.

If a Magic System completely trivializes the conflictd of the story, than the story won't grip the audience in the same way. Hence, the defining characteristic of really good Magic Systems are believalbe constraints that allow you to suspend your disbielf. Reasonalble constraints, in a strange but true way, are what allow creativity, as without any constraints characters could just instantly resolve the conflict of the story with their magic.

For example, when Luke Skywalker famously picks up the X-wing from the swamp on Degoba, it makes sense to our brains that it is difficult/straining to move something so large. It took disciple, training, and concuring his own inner demons to eventually become powerful in the Force. Had Luke had insane Force power from the very begining with no explanation and instatly defeated the entire Empire with them, I'd argue you'd have a horrible story.

Hence, the whole point of the Fogent Roleplay Magic rules is to help define resonable constraints on any magic systems. This means the magic systems is constrained enough to not completely break the narrative, but open for creative solutions with magic.

The trick with the Fogent Magic system is we already have the most important tools for covering most magic systems, skills and CLs. Whenever a player asks to use their Lift Skill to pick up a rock, the narrator/players already have a rough idea of how hard that check should be. We can use the same intuative understanding most of us have likely picked up from watch movies, reading books, or playing games to elegantly determine how difficult doing something with magic should be.

It is extremely intuative that a character with Fire magic could Trivially (CL 0) light a campfire, assuming they have the required wood. In the same vien, it would be common (CL 1) for a character with Fire Magic to shoot a fire bolt at something reasonably close. The point being is that we don't technically need super defined rules for how every Magic Skill exactly works. We as consumers of stories and narratives already reasonably understand what these things should be able to do.

The caveat is that having super defined spells are very nice to have as they allow people to share cool ways they though of to use their magic skills. Therefore, all the defined Spell are just one way someone reasonalby thought they could use a Magic Skill. This give the narrator/players the ability to get a rough idea of what a magic skill is capable of at that CL. And if you did want a super "rules-as-written"constrained magic systems, than you can totally just define the exact ways that magic can be used for a magic system or setting. You get to have your cake and eat it too!

### Reasonalbe Ranges of Narrative Spells

Below are guide lines for the Ranges that Magic Skill can be used at for general narrative purposes, usually similar to the Avatar: The Last Air Bender techniques.

A character may attempt to use their magic within the following Ranges depending on how much Magic Resource that is consumed.

If the Magic Skill used isn't Melee Capable, then any below option with the Range of Melee or Reach is unavailable. If the Magic Skill used isn't Ranged Capable, then any use of any ranged magic is unavailable.

| Magic Resource Consumed |      Range      |
| :---------------------: | :-------------: |
|            0            | Medium or Melee |
|            1            |  Far or Reach  |
|            2            |      Long      |
|            3            |     Distant     |
|            4            |  Sharpshooter  |

## Spells In Combat

If a character intends to use Spells during a combat round, on the Declaration Phase they can declare what spell they are attempting to use.

During the following Action Phase, during their action the character makes a Magic Skill Roll to see if they were able to achieve the spell they declared.

- A character can cast 1 spell per round that uses Magic Resource.
- A character can cast 1 spell per round that does not use Magic Resource.
- A character can only cast 1 spell per turn as part of their combat roll.

## Spell Concentration

Certain Spells demand a character's concentration to keep their effects active. If this concentration is interrupted, the Spell's magic ends.

If a Spell necessitates concentration, the Duration entry of the spell will indicate this, and it will specify how long you can concentrate on it. You can stop concentrating at any time.

Regular activities, like moving or attacking, don't disturb your concentration. However, the following factors can disrupt your concentration:

* Casting another spell that requires concentration. If you cast a spell that needs concentration while you're focusing on a different spell, you lose concentration on the first spell. You can't concentrate on two spells simultaneously.
* Suffering damage. If you take damage while focusing on a spell, you must make a Magic Governing Core Skill check to maintain your concentration. The challenge level is equal to the level of injury taken. If you take damage from multiple sources, you make a separate saving throw for each injury source.
* Becoming incapacitated or dying. If you're incapacitated or die, you lose concentration on a spell.
* The Narrator might also decide that certain environmental phenomena might require the concentrating character to succeed on a Governing Core Skill check to maintain concentration. For example, a wave washing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship might require a CL 2 Governing Core Skill Check.

## Generic Spells

Generic Spells can be used for creative purposes and are intended to allow/encourage players to try creative solutions. These spell are only limited by the character's stats, the player's creativity, and the narrator's supervision.

## Incompetent Spells

This level of proficiency with magic might be a fun party trick or for convenience but has no awe-inspiring use. Those with this level are objectively bad at using this skill. A Fire Magic skill would allow you to ignite your fingertips to light a cigar, though you could just use a match, flint and steel, or a lighter. You could throw hot smoke at someone's face, though you could just punch them in the face instead for similar if not better results.

For Fire Magic, this could be used to light a nearby candle. For Water Magic, this could be useful for levitating your ale into your mouth.

## Novice Spells (CL 0)

Novice magic spell that can be used for generic creative uses of magic. Generally only reserved for novice practitioners, dealing with minor threats to save magic resource, or as a desperate last resort after all magic resources are depleted. Otherwise known as Cantrips.

The hologram will also dissipate if you choose to dismiss it as an action or if you cast the spell again. If you choose to create an image of an object, such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest, it cannot exceed a 5 foot cube. When physically interacted with, the hologram is exposed as such because objects and beings can pass through it without obstruction. If a creature dedicates its action to scrutinizing the image, it may discern that it is an hologram by succeeding in a General Knowledge check against the wins from the Magic Skill roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The sound will also dissipate if you choose to dismiss it as an action or if you cast the spell again. You have control over its volume, which can vary from a mere whisper to a thunderous scream. It could resemble your own voice, another person's voice, the mighty roar of a lion, the rhythmic beat of drums, or any other sound you desire. The chosen sound will persist continuously throughout the spell's duration or you can produce discrete sounds at different moments before the spell concludes. If a creature dedicates its action to scrutinizing the sound, it may discern that it is an illusion by succeding a General Knowledge check against the wins from the Magic Skill roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Throughout the spell's duration, the object emits bright light in a 20-foot radius, accompanied by dim light for an additional 20 feet. You have the freedom to choose the color of the light. Should the object be fully covered with an opaque material, the emitted light is blocked. The spell concludes if cast anew or dismissed through an action. In the event that you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed in a Dodge roll or Combat Roll to evade the effects of the spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

This apparition persists for the spell's duration or until you choose to dismiss it. The hand dissipates if it strays beyond a the spells effective range or if you cast the spell anew. You have the ability command the hand. Its functions include manipulating objects, opening unlocked doors or containers, stowing or retrieving items from open containers, and pouring the contents out of a vial. The hand's movement speed is equal to it's effective range. It is roughly as strong as the users hand. If attacks are made with it, treat it as the users own unarmed attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
