# Spells

Spells are ways a character can use their Magic Skills.

To use a Spell a character must:

- Have the appropriate Magic Skills to perform said Spell.
- Achieve the CL required to cast said Spell with their Magic Skill Roll.
- Have Magic Resource to consume proportionate to the Spell's CL.

Certain spells can consume additional Magic Resource for improved effects. A spell can only consume as much Magic Resource as the wins from the Magic Skill Roll, including the normal amount.

## Spells in Narrative

### The Need For Reasonable Constraints On Magic

Stories/Narratives are at there very core about some conflict. Everyone loves well thought our magic systems because they add interesting ways to resolve conflicts within a story. Whether it be the Force from Star Wars, Bending from Avatar, or Wizardry from the Dresden Files, "magic" in each setting gives the heros and villains new ways to interact with the conflict of the story.

If a Magic System completely trivializes the conflict of the story, than the story won't grip the audience in the same way. Hence, the defining characteristic of really good Magic Systems are believable constraints that allow you to suspend your disbelief. Reasonable constraints, in a strange but true way, are what allow creativity, as without any constraints characters could just instantly resolve the conflict of the story with their magic.

For example, when Luke Skywalker famously picks up the X-wing from the swamp, it makes sense to our brains that it is difficult/straining to move something so large. It took disciple, training, and overcoming his own inner demons to eventually become powerful in the Force. Had Luke had insane Force power from the very beginning with no explanation and instantly defeated the entire Empire with them, I'd argue you'd have a horrible story.

Hence, the whole point of the Fogent Roleplay Magic rules is to help define reasonable constraints on any magic systems. This means the magic systems is constrained enough to not completely break the narrative, but open for creative solutions with magic.

### How To Elegantly Run Magic Systems

The trick with the Fogent Magic system is we already have the most important tools for covering most magic systems, skills and CLs. Whenever a player asks to use their Lift Skill to pick up a rock, the narrator/players already have a rough idea of how hard that check should be. We can use the same intuitive understanding most of us have likely picked up from watch movies, reading books, or playing games to elegantly determine how difficult doing something with magic should be.

It is extremely intuitive that a character with Fire magic could Trivially (CL 0) light a campfire, assuming they have the required wood. In the same vein, it would be common (CL 1) for a character with Fire Magic to shoot a fire bolt at something reasonably close. The point being is that we don't technically need super defined rules for how every Magic Skill exactly works. We as consumers of stories and narratives already reasonably understand what these things should be able to do.

The caveat is that having super defined spells are very nice to have as they allow people to share cool ways they though of to use their magic skills. Therefore, all the defined Spell are just one way someone reasonably thought they could use a Magic Skill. This give the narrator/players the ability to get a rough idea of what a magic skill is capable of at that CL. And if you did want a super "rules-as-written"constrained magic systems, than you can totally just define the exact ways that magic can be used for a magic system or setting. You get to have your cake and eat it too!

### Reasonable Ranges of Narrative Spells

Below are guide lines for the Ranges that Magic Skill can be used at for general narrative purposes, usually similar to the Avatar: The Last Air Bender techniques.

A character may attempt to use their magic within the following Ranges depending on how much Magic Resource that is consumed.

If the Magic Skill used isn't Melee Capable, then any below option with the Range of Melee or Reach is unavailable. If the Magic Skill used isn't Ranged Capable, then any use of any ranged magic is unavailable.

| Magic Resource Consumed |      Range      |
| :---------------------: | :-------------: |
|            0            | Medium or Melee |
|            1            |  Far or Reach  |
|            2            |      Long      |
|            3            |     Distant     |
|            4            |  Sharpshooter  |

## Spells In Combat

If a character intends to use Spells during a combat round, on the Declaration Phase they can declare what spell they are attempting to use.

During the following Action Phase, during their action the character makes a Magic Skill Roll to see if they were able to achieve the spell they declared.

- A character can cast 1 spell per round that uses Magic Resource.
- A character can cast 1 spell per round that does not use Magic Resource.
- A character can only cast 1 spell per turn as part of their combat roll.

### Spells as Combat Rolls

Almost all traditional offensive magic spells can be represented as Combat Roll Spells.

- Bone Claws = Bodily Magic Skill + Small Slashing Blade
- Fire Bolt = Fire Magic Skill + Light Crossbow
- Cone of Cold = Cold Magic + Mag. Medium Cone
- Water Whip = Water Magic Skill + Whip
- Earth Shield = Earth Magic + Large Shield

**Casting Time:** Instantaneous

**Duration:** 1 round

**Magic Skills required:** Any Magic Skill

From the Magic Skill used to cast this spell, create flavored magic armaments for use in combat. As part of the same spell, an armament can be created in each hand to benefit from the Dual Wielded Modifier. The Magic Combat Roll consists of the Magic Skill roll use to cast this spell plus the Dice Modifiers from the Magic Armament/s chosen from the tables below. Damage Types are determined by the Magic Skill used.

If the Magic Skill used isn't Melee Capable, then any below option with the Range of Melee or Reach is unavailable. If the Magic Skill used isn't Ranged Capable, then any use of any ranged magic is unavailable.

Shields can also be created as part of this spell, occupying a hand that is free. The Defense the shield provides is dependant on the Magic Skill used. For instance, while Earth magic could create a Physical Defense Shield, it could not create a Mental Defense Shield.

## Spell Concentration

Certain Spells demand a character's concentration to keep their effects active. If this concentration is interrupted, the Spell's magic ends.

If a Spell necessitates concentration, the Duration entry of the spell will indicate this, and it will specify how long you can concentrate on it. You can stop concentrating at any time.

Regular activities, like moving or attacking, don't disturb your concentration. However, the following factors can disrupt your concentration:

* Casting another spell that requires concentration. If you cast a spell that needs concentration while you're focusing on a different spell, you lose concentration on the first spell. You can't concentrate on two spells simultaneously.
* Suffering damage. If you take damage while focusing on a spell, you must make a Magic Governing Core Skill check to maintain your concentration. The challenge level is equal to the level of injury taken. If you take damage from multiple sources, you make a separate saving throw for each injury source.
* Becoming incapacitated or dying. If you're incapacitated or die, you lose concentration on a spell.
* The Narrator might also decide that certain environmental phenomena might require the concentrating character to succeed on a Governing Core Skill check to maintain concentration. For example, a wave washing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship might require a CL 2 Governing Core Skill Check.

## Incompetent Spells

This level of proficiency with magic might be a fun party trick or for convenience but has no awe-inspiring use. Those with this level are objectively bad at using this skill. A Fire Magic skill would allow you to ignite your fingertips to light a cigar, though you could just use a match, flint and steel, or a lighter. You could throw hot smoke at someone's face, though you could just punch them in the face instead for similar if not better results.

For Fire Magic, this could be used to light a nearby candle. For Water Magic, this could be useful for levitating your ale into your mouth.

## Novice Spells (CL 0)

Novice magic spell that can be used for generic creative uses of magic. Generally only reserved for novice practitioners, dealing with minor threats to save magic resource, or as a desperate last resort after all magic resources are depleted. Otherwise known as Cantrips.

If you choose to create an image of an object, such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest, it cannot exceed a 5 foot cube. When physically interacted with, the hologram is exposed as such because objects and beings can pass through it without obstruction.

Should the object be fully covered with an opaque material, the emitted light is blocked. The spell concludes if cast anew or dismissed through an action.

This apparition persists for the spell's duration or until you choose to dismiss it. The hand dissipates if it strays beyond a the spells effective range or if you cast the spell anew. You have the ability command the hand. Its functions include manipulating objects, opening unlocked doors or containers, stowing or retrieving items from open containers, and pouring the contents out of a vial. The hand's movement speed is equal to it's effective range. It is roughly as strong as the users hand. If attacks are made with it, treat it as the users own unarmed attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The target is aware there mind is being probed, and can either make a Communications check to deceive the mental invader, feeding them a false piece of information or Willpower check to force them out of their mind. The target has advantage if they are in combat with the caster or its allies. If the target is unable to resist, roll a d20, with the higher the roll being the more hidden the fact or secret. The target automatically resists the mental invasion if they are immune to being charmed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

This illusion manifests within range and persists for the spell's duration. It remains purely visual, lacking any accompanying sound, smell, or other sensory aspects. Using your action, you can maneuver the illusion to any location within range. As it moves, you can adjust its appearance to mimic natural movements, such as walking for a creature. Physical interaction with the illusion reveals its true nature, as objects pass through it unhindered. A creature can use its action to scrutinize the illusion, potentially discerning its falseness with a successful General Knowledge check against the Magic Skill Roll wins of this spell. Once the illusion is revealed, the creature can see through it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The target is required to make a Will versus the Magic Skill Rolls of this spell, gaining advantage if already engaged in combat with you or your allies. A failed check results in the creature being charmed (Charmed Condition) by you until the spell's conclusion or until you or your allies take hostile actions towards it. The charmed humanoid perceives you as a friendly acquaintance. Upon the conclusion of the spell, the creature becomes aware that it was under the influence of your charm. At Higher Magic Resource: For each magic resource consumed above it's normal requirement, you can select an additional character to target.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The distance they can vertically jump also becomes the distance they can fall without incurring damage. Any distance beyond that counts as normal falling distance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

A falling character's rate of descent slows to 10 feet per second. If the creature lands before the effect ends, it takes no falling damage and can land on its feet, and the effect for that creature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

The chosen target must make a successful Will saving throw or become paralyzed for the duration of the spell. At the conclusion of each of its turns, the affected creature has the opportunity to make another Will saving throw.

|    Read Thoughts    |         2         |   1 action   |  Medium  |  Concentration, 1 minute  |         Mind Magic         | During the spell's effect, you gain the ability to perceive the thoughts of specific creatures. When you cast the spell you can concentrate your mental focus on any visible creature within the spell's range. If the chosen creature possesses an -2 INT or lacks the ability to communicate through language, the spell has no effect. Initially, you access the surface thoughts of the creature, revealing its predominant concerns at that moment. You have the option to shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or delve deeper into the same creature's mind. When probing deeper, the targeted creature must succeed on a Will check versus the CL of the spell. Failure allows you to glean insights into its reasoning, emotional state, and significant preoccupations (such as worries, affections, or aversions). If successful, the spell terminates. Regardless of the outcome, the targeted creature becomes aware of your mental probing. Unless you shift your focus to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to initiate an Intelligence contest against your own; success terminates the spell. This spell proves particularly effective in interrogations, as questions directed at the target creature naturally influence its thought patterns. Additionally, you can employ this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures that are not visible to you. When casting the spell or as your action during its duration, you can scan for thoughts within the spells range. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead obstruct the ability. Creatures with an -2 INT or those lacking any language are undetectable. Upon detecting the presence of a creature using this method, you can read its thoughts for the remainder of the duration, following the same rules as described earlier, even if the creature is out of sight but still within range. |
