# Spells

Spells are ways a character can use their Magic Skills.

Players/Narrators can create Spells on the fly with the Narrator's approval. For instance, there is no need to have a predefined Spell for lighting a campfire with Fire Magic or clearing a collapsed tunnel with Earth Magic. The player can just describe what they are about to attempt with their magic and the Narrator will set the CL of the Spell just like any other skill check.

If the created Spell is worth remembering for later use or to share, it can be written down as a Spell such as in the Spell Tables below. It is worth remembering that the Spells on the table below are simply a snapshot of how someone used a Magic Skill for a Spell that they thought was reasonable. If a Narrator wanted to run a game with only pre-defined Spells (such as how DnD does) then they absolutely can.

To use a Spell a character must:

- Have the required Magic Skill to perform the Spell.
- Achieve the CL required to cast the Spell with their Magic Skill Roll.
- Have Magic Resource to consume proportionate to the Spell's CL.

Certain spells can consume additional Magic Resource to increase the Spell's effect. A Spell can only consume as much Magic Resource as the wins from the Magic Skill Roll.

## Reasonable Ranges of Spells

Below are guide lines for the Ranges that Magic Skill can be used at for general narrative purposes, usually similar to the Avatar: The Last Air Bender techniques.

A character may attempt to use their magic within the following Ranges depending on how much Magic Resource that is consumed. If the Magic Skill used isn't Melee Capable, then any below option with the Range of Melee or Reach is unavailable. If the Magic Skill used isn't Ranged Capable, then any use of any ranged magic is unavailable.

| Magic Resource Consumed |      Range      |
| :---------------------: | :-------------: |
|            0            | Medium or Melee |
|            1            |  Far or Reach  |
|            2            |      Long      |
|            3            |     Distant     |
|            4            |  Sharpshooter  |

## Spell Concentration

Certain Spells demand a character's concentration to keep their effects active. If this concentration is interrupted, the Spell's magic ends.

If a Spell necessitates concentration, the Duration entry of the spell will indicate this, and it will specify how long you can concentrate on it. You can stop concentrating at any time.

Regular activities, like moving or attacking, don't disturb your concentration. However, the following factors can disrupt your concentration:

* Casting another spell that requires concentration. If you cast a spell that needs concentration while you're focusing on a different spell, you lose concentration on the first spell. You can't concentrate on two spells simultaneously.
* Suffering damage. If you take damage while focusing on a spell, you must make a Magic Governing Core Skill check to maintain your concentration. The challenge level is equal to the level of injury taken. If you take damage from multiple sources, you make a separate saving throw for each injury source.
* Becoming incapacitated or dying. If you're incapacitated or die, you lose concentration on a spell.
* The Narrator might also decide that certain environmental phenomena might require the concentrating character to succeed on a Governing Core Skill check to maintain concentration. For example, a wave washing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship might require a CL 2 Governing Core Skill Check.

## Using Spells In Combat

If a character intends to use Spells during a combat round, on the Declaration Phase they will declare what Spell they are attempting to use with the following rules in mind.

- A character can cast 1 spell per round that uses Magic Resource.
- A character can cast 1 spell per round that does not use Magic Resource.
- A character can only cast 1 spell per turn as their combat roll.

On the Action Phase, the character makes a Magic Skill roll to see if they were able to achieve the Spell they declared. If they succeed, the Spell is cast. If the Spell was a Weapon Spell, than the additional dice from the Weapon Spell are rolled and are combined with the already rolled Magic Skill dice, making up the Magic Combat Roll. If they were unsuccessful in casting the spell, the Spell is not cast but the magic resource is still consumed.

## Weapon Spells

**Casting Time:** Instantaneous

**Duration:** 1 round

From the Magic Skill used to cast this Spell, create flavored magic armaments for use in combat. As part of the same Weapon Spell, an armament can be created in each hand to benefit from the Dual Wielded Modifier or shield. The Defense the shield provides is dependant on the Magic Skill used. For instance, while Earth magic could create a Physical Defense Shield, it could not create a Mental Defense Shield.

Damage Types are determined by the Magic Skill used.

If the Magic Skill used isn't Melee Capable, then any below option with the Range of Melee or Reach is unavailable. If the Magic Skill used isn't Ranged Capable, then any use of any ranged magic is unavailable.

Weapon Spell Combat Roll = (Magic Skill roll) + (Weapon Spell Dice Modifiers)

Almost all traditional offensive magic spells can be represented as Weapon Spells.

- Bone Claws = Bodily Magic Skill + Small Slashing Blade
- Fire Bolt = Fire Magic Skill + Light Crossbow
- Cone of Cold = Cold Magic + Magic Medium Cone
- Water Whip = Water Magic Skill + Whip
- Earth Shield = Earth Magic + Large Shield

The hologram will also dissipate if you choose to dismiss it as an action or if you cast the spell again. If you choose to create an image of an object, such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest, it cannot exceed a 5 foot cube. When physically interacted with, the hologram is exposed as such because objects and beings can pass through it without obstruction. If a creature dedicates its action to scrutinizing the image, it may discern that it is an hologram by succeeding in a General Knowledge check against the wins from the Magic Skill roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

It must be within the effective range of the spell and it persists for the spell's duration. The illusion will also dissipate if you choose to dismiss it as an action or if you cast the spell again. When you opt for a sound, you have control over its volume, which can vary from a mere whisper to a thunderous scream.

The chosen sound will persist continuously throughout the spell's duration, or you can produce discrete sounds at different moments before the spell concludes. If you choose to create an image of an object, such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest, it cannot exceed a 5 foot cube. This illusory image lacks the ability to produce sound, light, scent, or any other sensory effects. When physically interacted with, the illusion is exposed as such because objects and beings can pass through it without obstruction. If a creature dedicates its action to scrutinizing the sound or image, it may discern that it is an illusion by succeeding in an Will check against the wins from the Magic Skill roll. If a creature successfully identifies the illusion, it becomes faint and transparent to that creature. |

Throughout the spell's duration, the object emits bright light in a 20-foot radius, accompanied by dim light for an additional 20 feet. You have the freedom to choose the color of the light. Should the object be fully covered with an opaque material, the emitted light is blocked. The spell concludes if cast anew or dismissed through an action. In the event that you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed in a Dodge roll or Combat Roll to evade the effects of the spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

At Higher Magic Resource, for each additional Magic Resource spent over base amount, healing tier increases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The target makes a Will Check versus the Magic Skill Roll of this spell. If successful, this spell inflicts an extra Minor Necrotic Injury whenever you inflict an injury. Additionally, you can select one of the target's core skills to impose a disadvantage on. If the target's is rendered unconscious or killed before the spell ends, you have the opportunity to bewitch another creature on a subsequent turn of yours. If a spell remove a curse from a target than this spell ends early.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

While the intelligence of many beasts may limit their knowledge and awareness, they can, at a minimum, provide information about nearby locations and creatures, based on their perceptions from the past day. Depending on the Narrator's judgment, you might also be able to persuade a beast to carry out a small task for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

You can change your height by up to one foot and manipulate your apparent physique to appear thin, fat, or anything in between. However, you cannot alter your fundamental body structure, necessitating adherence to a form with a similar limb arrangement. Beyond this restriction, the extent of changes is within your control. Despite the alterations, if this spell is used to mimic another's appearance, depending on the skill level of the caster certain details might be off at close distances, especially for those that would know the mimicked character. To expose your disguise, a character can spend its action inspecting your appearance and must succeed in an General Knowledge check versus the wins achieved when this spell is cast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The target is aware there mind is being probed, and can either make a Communications check to deceive the mental invader, feeding them a false piece of information or Willpower check to force them out of their mind. The target has advantage if they are in combat with the caster or its allies. If the target is unable to resist, roll a d20, with the higher the roll being the more hidden the fact or secret. The target automatically resists the mental invasion if they are immune to being charmed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

This illusion manifests within range and persists for the spell's duration. It remains purely visual, lacking any accompanying sound, smell, or other sensory aspects. Using your action, you can maneuver the illusion to any location within range. As it moves, you can adjust its appearance to mimic natural movements, such as walking for a creature. Physical interaction with the illusion reveals its true nature, as objects pass through it unhindered. A creature can use its action to scrutinize the illusion, potentially discerning its falseness with a successful General Knowledge check against the Magic Skill Roll wins of this spell. Once the illusion is revealed, the creature can see through it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The target is required to make a Will versus the Magic Skill Rolls of this spell, gaining advantage if already engaged in combat with you or your allies. A failed check results in the creature being charmed (Charmed Condition) by you until the spell's conclusion or until you or your allies take hostile actions towards it. The charmed humanoid perceives you as a friendly acquaintance. Upon the conclusion of the spell, the creature becomes aware that it was under the influence of your charm.

A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity Check or fall prone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The distance they can vertically jump also becomes the distance they can fall without incurring damage. Any distance beyond that counts as normal falling distance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

A falling character's rate of descent slows to 10 feet per second. If the creature lands before the effect ends, it takes no falling damage and can land on its feet, and the effect for that creature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Throughout the spell's duration, the ground in this zone transforms into difficult terrain. Any creature caught within the area upon casting must pass a Lift Check versus the spell's wins or restrained condition by the entwining plants until the spell concludes. A creature entangled can use its action to attempt a Lift check versus the spell's Wins. If successful, it breaks free. Once the spell dissipates, the summoned foliage withers and fades away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The chosen target must make a successful Will saving throw or become paralyzed for the duration of the spell. At the conclusion of each of its turns, the affected creature has the opportunity to make another Will saving throw. If successful, the spell concludes on that specific target.``At Higher Magic Resource: For each magic resource consumed above it's normal requirement, you can select an additional character to target.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|         Read Thoughts         |         2         |   1 action   |  Medium  |  Concentration, 1 minute  |           Mind Magic           | During the spell's effect, you gain the ability to perceive the thoughts of specific creatures. When you cast the spell you can concentrate your mental focus on any visible creature within the spell's range. If the chosen creature possesses an -2 INT or lacks the ability to communicate through language, the spell has no effect. Initially, you access the surface thoughts of the creature, revealing its predominant concerns at that moment. You have the option to shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or delve deeper into the same creature's mind. When probing deeper, the targeted creature must succeed on a Will check versus the CL of the spell. Failure allows you to glean insights into its reasoning, emotional state, and significant preoccupations (such as worries, affections, or aversions). If successful, the spell terminates. Regardless of the outcome, the targeted creature becomes aware of your mental probing. Unless you shift your focus to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to initiate an Intelligence contest against your own; success terminates the spell. This spell proves particularly effective in interrogations, as questions directed at the target creature naturally influence its thought patterns. Additionally, you can employ this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures that are not visible to you. When casting the spell or as your action during its duration, you can scan for thoughts within the spells range. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead obstruct the ability. Creatures with an -2 INT or those lacking any language are undetectable. Upon detecting the presence of a creature using this method, you can read its thoughts for the remainder of the duration, following the same rules as described earlier, even if the creature is out of sight but still within range. |
