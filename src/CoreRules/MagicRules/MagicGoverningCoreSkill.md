# Magic Governing Core Skill

A Magic Governing Core Skill is a Core Skill that is tangently associated with a Magic Skill. Used for instances when a character over-exerts themselves with their Magic Skill, is trying to rapidly regain Magic Resource, or maintain concentration on already cast spell.

* Magic that relies on the body to produce Magic Resource uses Endurance as its governing core skill.
* Magic that relies on the mind or spirit to produce Magic Resources uses Will as their governing core skill.
* Magic that relies upon a belief in a divine higher power might use Will as their governing core skill.
* Magic that relies upon a relationship with a divine being or a pact with a nefarious entity could use Communication, as it is only through the connection to the entity that the magic is held together.
* Magic that relies upon one's connection with nature could use Survival.
