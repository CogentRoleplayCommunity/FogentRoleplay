### The Need For Reasonable Constraints On Magic

Stories are at there very core about some conflict. Everyone loves well thought our magic systems because they add interesting ways to resolve conflicts within a story. Whether it be the Force from Star Wars, Bending from Avatar, or Wizardry from the Dresden Files, "magic" in each setting gives the heros and villains new ways to interact with the conflict of the story.

If a Magic System completely trivializes the conflict of the story, than the story won't grip the audience in the same way. Hence, the defining characteristic of really good Magic Systems are believable constraints that allow you to suspend your disbelief. Reasonable constraints, in a strange but true way, are what allow creativity, as without any constraints characters could just instantly resolve the conflict of the story with their magic.

For example, when Luke Skywalker famously picks up the X-wing from the swamp, it makes sense to our brains that it is difficult and straining to move something so large. It took disciple, training, and overcoming his own inner demons to eventually become powerful in the Force. Had Luke had insane Force power from the very beginning with no explanation and instantly defeated the entire Empire with them, I'd argue you'd have a horrible story.

Hence, the whole point of the Fogent Roleplay Magic rules is to help define reasonable constraints on any magic systems. This means the magic systems is constrained enough to not completely break the narrative, but open for creative solutions with magic.

### How To Elegantly Run Magic Systems

The trick with the Fogent Magic system is we already have the most important tools for covering most magic systems, skills and CLs. Whenever a player asks to use their Lift Skill to pick up a rock, the narrator and players already have a rough idea of how hard that check should be. We can use the same intuitive understanding most of us have likely picked up from watch movies, reading books, or playing games to elegantly determine how difficult doing something with magic should be.

It is extremely intuitive that a character with Fire magic could Trivially (CL 0) light a campfire, assuming they have the required wood. In the same vein, it would be common (CL 1) for a character with Fire Magic to shoot a fire bolt at something reasonably close. The point being is that we don't technically need super defined rules for how every Magic Skill exactly works. We as consumers of stories and narratives already reasonably understand what these things should be able to do.

The caveat is that having super defined spells are very nice to have as they allow people to share cool ways they though of to use their magic skills. Therefore, all the defined Spell are just one way someone reasonably thought they could use a Magic Skill. This give the narrator and players the ability to get a rough idea of what a magic skill is capable of at that CL. And if you did want a super "rules-as-written"constrained magic systems, than you can totally just define the exact ways that magic can be used for a magic system or setting. You get to have your cake and eat it too!
