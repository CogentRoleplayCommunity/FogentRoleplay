## Magic Roll

This roll represents your abilities with a specific type of Magic skill. A minimum of one Resource is required to make a non-Cantrip Magic Roll. Resources up to the level in the user's Magic vocation can be consumed, adding an additional d6 to the Magic Roll for each Magic Resource consumed.

- Magic Skill Roll = 3d6 (base) + Xd6 (Magic Skill) + Xd6 (Vocation Attributes) + Xd6 (Resource consumed capped by Magic Vocation level) + Xd6 (Conduit Dice Modification)
