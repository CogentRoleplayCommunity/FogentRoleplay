# Magic Skills

Magic Skills represent the ability to manipulate and control different magic concepts or elements.

The CL of any Magic Skill check is proportionate to the amount of Magic Resource required as fuel to attempt the roll, unless otherwise stated.

## Unlocking Magic Skills

Novice Tier Magic Skills (level 0) can be unlocked under an appropriate Magic Vocation for 1 skill point.

Incompetent Magic Skills (level -1) can be given by the Narrator as appropriate with the narrative. In general, a character with a level 0 Magic Vocation can have 1 Narrator given Incompetent magic skill, gaining 1 additional Incompetent magic skill per increase to the Magic Vocation Level.

Examples of unlocking Incompetent Magic Skills:

* A minute latent genetic potential, such as from the race of the character. (Sorcerer)
* Partial knowledge of a type of magic learned quickly on the fly without the required study to be considered a novice. (Wizard)
* A minuet blessing bestowed by a deity. (Cleric)
* A taste of power from an entity looking to make a deal... (Warlock)
* A natural element foreign to a character's place of origin. (Druid)

## Combo Magic Skills

Another avenue to explore is how magic skills could be combined.

- Plasma Magic = Heat Magic + Air Magic
- Storm Magic = Air Magic + Electricity Magic + Water Magic
- Magma Magic = Earth Magic + Heat Magic
- Blizzard Magic = Cold Magic + Air Magic
- Frost Magic = Water Magic + Cold Magic

## Magic Conduits

All magic needs a conduit to be cast through wether a wizard's staff, a druid's focus, or even a character's own body. Just about anything can be made into a conduit from a narrative perspective, but it is up to the narrator to decide if their are any restrictions in their setting. A Conduit's tier influences any magic cast through it, effecting the resulting base dice of any Magic Skill Roll.
