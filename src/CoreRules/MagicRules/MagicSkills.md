### Unlocking Magic

You unlock an amount of Magic Skill depending on your Magic Vocation level. All magic skills start at the Party Trick Tier (level -1: incompetent).

| Magic Vocation Level | Magic Skills known |
| :------------------: | :----------------: |
|          0          |         1         |
|          1          |         3         |
|          2          |         5         |
|          3          |         7         |
|          4          |         9         |

#### Party Trick Tier (Level -1: Incompetent)

Requires an investment of 0 skill point to unlock. Generally acquired during character creation, increasing your vocation level or through narrative means.

Examples include:

* A minuet latent genetic potential, such as from the race of the character. (Sorcerer)
* Partial knowledge of a type of magic learned quickly on the fly without the required study to be considered a novice. (Wizard)
* A minuet blessing bestowed by a deity. (Cleric)
* A taste of power from an entity looking to make a deal... (Warlock)
* A part of nature foreign to your place of origin. (Druid)

This level of proficiency with magic might be a fun party trick or for convenience but has no awe inspiring use. Those with this level are objectively bad at using this skill. A fire magic skill would allow you to ignite your finger tips to light a cigar, though you could just use a match, flint and steel, or a lighter. You could throw hot smoke at someones face, though you could just punch them in the face instead for similar if not better results.
