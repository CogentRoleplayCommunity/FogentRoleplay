# Magic Skills

Magic skills represent the ability to manipulate and control different magic concepts or elements.

Characters can unlock Magic Skills covered by their Magic Vocation at Novice (0) level for 1 skill point.

The CL of any Magic Skill check is proportionate to the amount of Magic Resource required as fuel to attempt the roll, unless otherwise stated.

## Generic Magic Skill List

Below is a non-exhaustive list of common magic types, feel free to create your own. You can also try grouping different magic concepts under one magic skill for a magic system. For instance, in the popular video game Skyrim, the Destruction school of magic covered Fire, Ice, and Lightning.

## Combo Magic Skills

Another avenue to explore is how magic skills could be combined.

- Plasma Magic = Heat Magic + Air Magic
- Storm Magic = Air Magic + Electricity Magic + Water Magic
- Magma Magic = Earth Magic + Heat Magic
- Blizzard Magic = Cold Magic + Air Magic
- Frost Magic = Water Magic + Cold Magic

## Magic Conduits

All magic needs a conduit to be cast through wether a wizard's staff, a druid's focus, or even a character's own body. Just about anything can be made into a conduit from a narrative perspective, but it is up to the narrator to decide if their are any restrictions in their setting. A Conduit's tier influences any magic cast through it, effecting the resulting base dice of any Magic Skill Roll.

## Magic Skill Roll

Magic Skill Roll =

- 3d6 (Base Dice, varies with Conduit Item Tier Base Dice Modification)
- +Xd6 (per Magic Skill)
- +Xd6 (per Magic Skill Governing Attributes)

## Incompetent Magic Skills

Incompetent (level -1) Magic Skills might be enough for a fun party trick or trivial tasks. Characters with this level of Magic Skill are objectively poor at using said Magic Skill.

Characters with Incompetent Magic Skills can only cast Incompetent Tier Spells.

Examples of Incompetent Magic Skill uses:

- Incompetent Fire Magic skill would allow you to ignite your fingertips to light a cigar, though you could just use a match, flint and steel, or a lighter.
- Incompetent Fire Magic could allow the user to throw hot smoke at someone's face, though you could just punch them in the face instead for similar if not better results.
- Incompetent Fire Magic could be used to light a nearby candle.
- Incompetent Water Magic could be used to control ale into a character's mouth like a straw.

### Narrator Given Incompetent Magic Skills

The Narrator can give a character an Incompetent Magic Skills as appropriate with the narrative.

Examples of unlocking Incompetent Magic Skills:

* A minute latent genetic potential, such as from the race of the character. (Sorcerer)
* Partial knowledge of a type of magic learned quickly on the fly without the required study to be considered a novice. (Wizard)
* A minuet blessing bestowed by a deity. (Cleric)
* A taste of power from an entity looking to make a deal... (Warlock)
* A natural element foreign to a character's place of origin. (Druid)
