# Generic Party Trick

A short ranged minor spell, which has such a small effect it requires no magic resource. This level of proficiency with magic might be a fun party trick or for convenience but has no awe inspiring use. For Fire Magic, this could be used to light a candle across a room. For Water Magic, this could be useful for levitating you ale into your mouth.
