# Melee Cantrip

A melee focused minor spell, which has such a small effect it requires no magic resource. This level of proficiency with magic might be a fun party trick or for convenience but has no awe inspiring use. For Fire Magic, this could be used to ignite your finger tips. For Cold Magic, this could be used to chill the drink in your hand. For Body Magic, this could be used to make your nails grow slightly longer. Creativity is encouraged!

Use of Melee Cantrips in combat is genrally only reserved for dealing with minor threats to save magic resource or as a desperate last resort after all magic resources are depleted.
