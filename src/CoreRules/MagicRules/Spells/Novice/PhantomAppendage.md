# Phantom Appendage

A spectral and ethereal hand materializes at a designated point within the spell's range. This apparition persists for the spell's duration or until you choose to dismiss it. The hand dissipates if it strays beyond a the spells effective range or if you cast the spell anew.

You have the ability command the hand. Its functions include manipulating objects, opening unlocked doors or containers, stowing or retrieving items from open containers, and pouring the contents out of a vial. The hand's movement speed is equal to it's effective range. It is roughly as strong as the users hand. If attacks are made with it, treat it as the users own unarmed attacks.
