# Hold Humaniod

Select a humanoid visible within the spell's range. The chosen target must make a successful Will saving throw or become paralyzed for the duration of the spell. At the conclusion of each of its turns, the affected creature has the opportunity to make another Will saving throw. If successful, the spell concludes on that specific target.

At Higher Levels: If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can choose an additional humanoid for each slot level beyond 2nd. The selected humanoids must be within 30 feet of each other at the time of targeting.
