# Charm Humaniod

You endeavor to enchant a humanoid that is within your visible range. The target is required to make a Will saving throw, gaining advantage if engaged in combat with you or your allies. A failed saving throw results in the creature being charmed by you until the spell's conclusion or until you or your allies take hostile actions towards it. The charmed entity perceives you as a friendly acquaintance. Upon the conclusion of the spell, the creature becomes aware that it was under the influence of your charm.

At Higher Levels: If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can select an additional creature for each slot level beyond 1st. All chosen creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when targeted.
