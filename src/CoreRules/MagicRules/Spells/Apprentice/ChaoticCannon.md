## Chaotic Cannon

Launch a fluctuating, oscillating surge of disorderly energy at a single creature within your range. Roll d8s determined by the level of the Magic (see below) and chose one. The value of the chosen dice dictates the type of damage inflicted by the attack, as indicated in the table below.

| d8 | Damage Type |
| :-: | :---------: |
| 1 |    Acid    |
| 2 |    Cold    |
| 3 |    Fire    |
| 4 |  Shockwave  |
| 5 |  Electric  |
| 6 |   Poison   |
| 7 |   Psychic   |
| 8 |  Bludgeon  |

In the event that you roll matching numbers on the at least two d8s, the unpredictable energy bounces off the initial target, moving to another creature of your choosing within a 30-foot radius, were the same combat roll is used versus the new opponent. This may, in turn, cause the energy to bounce yet again.

Each casting of this spell can only target a creature once.
