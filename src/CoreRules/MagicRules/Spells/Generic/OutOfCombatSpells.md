Generic Magic can be used for creative purposes and is meant to allow/encourage players to try interesting things, limited only by the character's stats, the player's creativity, and the narrator's supervision.

A character may attempt to use their magic within the following Ranges depending on how much Magic Resource that is consumed.

If the Magic Skill used isn't Melee Capable, then any below option with the Range of Melee or Reach is unavailable. If the Magic Skill used isn't Ranged Capable, then any use of any ranged magic is unavailable.

| Magic Resource Consumed |      Range      |
| :---------------------: | :-------------: |
|            0            | Medium or Melee |
|            1            |  Far or Reach  |
|            2            |      Long      |
|            3            |     Distant     |

## Incompetent Generic Magic

This level of proficiency with magic might be a fun party trick or for convenience but has no awe-inspiring use. Those with this level are objectively bad at using this skill. A Fire Magic skill would allow you to ignite your fingertips to light a cigar, though you could just use a match, flint and steel, or a lighter. You could throw hot smoke at someone's face, though you could just punch them in the face instead for similar if not better results.

For Fire Magic, this could be used to light a nearby candle. For Water Magic, this could be useful for levitating your ale into your mouth.

Examples include:

* A minute latent genetic potential, such as from the race of the character. (Sorcerer)
* Partial knowledge of a type of magic learned quickly on the fly without the required study to be considered a novice. (Wizard)
* A minuet blessing bestowed by a deity. (Cleric)
* A taste of power from an entity looking to make a deal... (Warlock)
* A part of nature foreign to your place of origin. (Druid)
