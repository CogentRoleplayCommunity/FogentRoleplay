# Illuminate

You make contact with an object, its size not exceeding 10 feet in any dimension. Throughout the spell's duration, the object emits bright light in a 20-foot radius, accompanied by dim light for an additional 20 feet. You have the freedom to choose the color of the light. Should the object be fully covered with an opaque material, the emitted light is blocked. The spell concludes if cast anew or dismissed through an action.

In the event that you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed in a Dodge roll vs a Light Magic Combat Roll to evade the effects of the spell.
