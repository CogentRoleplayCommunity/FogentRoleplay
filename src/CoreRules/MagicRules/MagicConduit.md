## Magic Conduit

All magic needs a conduit to be cast through wether a wizards staff, a druids focus, or even your own body. Just about anything can be made into a conduit from a narrative perspective, but it is up to the narrator to decide if their are any restrictions.

Example Conduit:

| Name               | One<br />Handed | Two<br />Handed | Dual<br /> Wielded | Additional<br />Penetration | Additional<br />Damage<br />Types | Engageable<br />Opponents | Area Of<br />Effect | Resource<br />Class | Effected<br />Magic Skills |
| ------------------ | --------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Blazecraft Conduit | +1d6            | +1d6            | None               | 0                           |                                   | None                      | None                | None                | Blazecraft                 |

- One Handed: Dice bonus given by wielding the conduit in one hand.
- Two Handed: Dice Bonus given by wielding the conduit in two hand. Narratively this could be requiring the character to channel magic through both hands for greater effect.
- Dual Wielded: Dice bonus given when wielding two conduits that are both capable of being dual wielded that effect the same magic skill. Think dual wielding fire magic wands.
- Additional Penetration: Extra penetration added to combat rolls made with this conduit, added to the normal penetration.
- Additional Damage Types: Extra damage types to be added onto combat rolls made with this conduit.
- Engageable Opponents: Changes engageable opponent type when making a combat roll. This could be a fast shooting wand or a slow shooting staff that pacts a large wallop.
- Area Of Effect: Adds an innate area of effect to every combat roll made with the conduit. This is very powerful.
- Resource Class: Additional resource consumed by the conduit when used.
- Effected Magic Skills: Which Magic skill the conduit can be used with.
