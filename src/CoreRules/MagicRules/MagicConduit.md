## Magic Conduit

All magic needs a conduit to be cast through wether a wizards staff, a druids focus, or even your own body. Just about anything can be made into a conduit from a narrative perspective, but it is up to the narrator to decide if their are any restrictions. A Conduits tier influences any magic cast through it, effecting the resulting base dice of any Magic Skill Roll or Magic Combat Roll.
