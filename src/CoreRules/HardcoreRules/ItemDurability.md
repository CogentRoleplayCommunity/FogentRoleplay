## Item Durability (Optional)

This is an optional rule for setting where the durability of ones equipment has narrative significance. Using item durability is a great way to increase immersion (such as having to go to a blacksmith or learn to repair their gear) and challenge your players. However, for players who want a more casual experience, item durability can be disregarded.

With these rules, all weapons, armor, and spellcasting focuses now have durability. Whatever the Base Dice Tier associated with that item determines how much durability it has. When an item's durability falls, each time your item's durability falls to the lower tier's max durability, that lower tier's base dice are used instead. For instance, if a character had a "Legendary\" Base Dice Tier sword with only 23 durability remaineg they would be rolling the "Superior" Base Dice Tier or "1d10, 2d8".

### Weapon Durability

A weapon's Durability decreases by 1 whenever a weapon is used to attempt to inflict an injury level.

### Spellcasting Focus Durability

A Spellcasting Focus's durability decreases by 1 whenever a Spell is cast with it.

### Armor Durability

If an injury is fully negated by armor, then the defender can decide which pieces of armor take armor damage. The armor must sum up to the defense level required to prevent the incoming injury and all take the same amount of armor damage. An armor's durability decreases by the level of injury inflicted plus the attack's defense penetration.

- Armor damage = (level of injury inflicted) + (combat roll penetration)

If an injury is not fully negated by the defender's armor, then all pieces of armor take armor damage.
