# Defense And Penetration

Depending on the damage type, different types of defense can be used to reduce injuries. A character can then reduce a injury level by the equivalent amount of defense they have to that damage type. The only way to injure an opponent with a specific defense is to exceed, or bypass it.

## Physical Defense

A measure of a character's resistance to all physical injuries. Calculated by summing all a character's physical defenses and rounding down. A character can wear two pieces of armor in the same category, such as wearing a gambeson under chain mail or a breastplate, which was most certainly done in history. In these circumstances the most efficient ways of defeating a person in armor is grappling them or tripping them and holding them down, just like in real life.

If a combat roll has a physical damage type and a damage type that would require an Bodily, Mental, or Spiritual defense roll, than since it is combined with the physical attack it is only versus physical defense. An example would be poison applied to the blade of a weapon.

### Physical Defense from Shields

Character's not actively using their shield as part of their combat/dodge roll do not benefit from the additional defense. Character's are flanked or being attack from while unaware also do not benefit from the shield's defense.

## Bodily Defense

A measure of a character's resistance to affliction. Determines your body's ability to resist poisoning, bleeding, freezing, etc. Wins determined by an Endurance skill check act as your defense against injury. The character may also abstain from rolling, choosing to take the average number of wins given the size of the dice pool. This can be calculated by dividing the amount of dice rolled by 2 than rounding down. The wins achieved by this are reduced by an attacker's combat roll penetration.

## Mental Defense

A measure of a character's bulwark against all mental injuries and influence. Wins determined by a Will skill check act as your defense against injury. The character may also abstain from rolling, choosing to take the average number of wins given the size of their dice pool. This can be calculated by dividing the amount of dice rolled by 2 than rounding down. The wins achieved by this are reduced by an attacker's combat roll penetration.

## Soul Defense

A measure of a character's bulwark against all spiritual injuries and influence. Wins determined by a Will skill check act as your defense against injury. The character may also abstain from rolling, choosing to take the average number of wins given the size of their dice pool. This can be calculated by dividing the amount of dice rolled by 2 than rounding down. The wins achieved by this are reduced by an attacker's combat roll penetration.

## Penetration

Penetration represents an combat rolls ability to mitigate the opponents defense. While dealing an injury, you may reduce your opponents Defense level by your attacks penetration before calculating injury.

For penetration versus physical defense, primarly being armor, weapons with strong penetration include bludgeoning weapons such as a mace or war hammer, which historically were one of the primary way of defeating heavy armor. To a lesser extent, thrusting weapons such as dagger or spears also have decent penetration versus physical defense, as they can be used to thrust into weak point in armor. Slashing swords would have some of the worst penetration, as it is highly unlikely to be able to slice through the armor.

For penetration versus Bodily, Mental, and Soul Defense, penetration represent the attacks effect being harder to resist. For instance, it is far easier to resist taking injury from a single poison bolt versus being covered in a poison mist area of effect.
