# Defense And Penetration

Depending on the damage type, different types of defense can be used to reduce injuries. A character can then reduce an injury level by the equivalent amount of defense they have to that damage type. The only way to injure an opponent with a specific defense is to exceed, or bypass it.

## Physical Defense

A measure of a character's defense to all physical injuries. Calculated by summing all a character's physical defenses and rounding down. A character can wear two pieces of armor in the same category, such as wearing a gambeson under chain mail or a breastplate, which was most certainly done in history. In these circumstances, the most efficient way of defeating a person in heavy armor is grappling them or tripping them and holding them down, just like in real life.

If a combat roll has a Physical damage type and a Bodily, Mental, or Spiritual damage type, then since it is combined with the physical attack it is only versus physical defense. An example would be poison applied to the blade of a weapon.

### Armor Classes

Armor Class determines what portions of a character a piece of armor will protect. There are 4 different armor types.

- Head
- Body
- Arm
- Leg

### Shield Class

The class of "Shield" marks an item that can be used as a shield for defensive purposes. This takes up one of the character's hands when in use.

Characters not actively using their shield as part of their combat/dodge roll do not benefit from the additional defense. Characters that are Off Guard or being attacked while unaware also do not benefit from the shield's defense.

## Bodily Defense

A measure of a character's defense to injury from Bodily damage types. Determines your body's ability to resist poisoning, bleeding, freezing, etc. Wins determined by an Endurance skill check act as your defense against injury. The character may also abstain from rolling, choosing to take the average number of wins given the size of the dice pool. This can be calculated by dividing the number of dice rolled by 2 and then rounding down. The wins achieved by this are reduced by an attacker's combat roll penetration.

## Mental Defense

A measure of a character's defense to injury from Mental damage types. Wins determined by a Will skill check act as your defense against injury. The character may also abstain from rolling, choosing to take the average number of wins given the size of their dice pool. This can be calculated by dividing the number of dice rolled by 2 and then rounding down. The wins achieved by this are reduced by an attacker's combat roll penetration.

## Soul Defense

A measure of a character's defense to injury from Soul damage types. Wins determined by a Will skill check act as your defense against injury. The character may also abstain from rolling, choosing to take the average number of wins given the size of their dice pool. This can be calculated by dividing the number of dice rolled by 2 and then rounding down. The wins achieved by this are reduced by an attacker's combat roll penetration.

## Penetration

Penetration represents a combat roll's ability to mitigate the opponent's defense. While dealing with an injury, you may reduce your opponent's Defense level by your combat roll's Penetration before calculating injury.

For penetration versus Physical Defense, primarily being armor, weapons with strong penetration include bludgeoning weapons such as a mace or war hammer, which historically were one of the primary ways of defeating heavy armor. To a lesser extent, thrusting weapons such as daggers or spears also have decent penetration versus physical defense, as they can be used to thrust into weak points in armor. Slashing swords would have some of the worst penetration, as it is highly unlikely to be able to slice through the armor.

For penetration versus Bodily, Mental, and Soul Defense, Penetration represents the attack's effect being harder to resist. For instance, it is far easier to resist taking injury from a single poison bolt versus being covered in a poison mist area of effect.
