# Combat Modifiers

Combat Modifiers represent different circumstances a character can encounter while in combat.

## Defensive (Advantage) (no victory levels)

This is when a character purely focuses on defending themselves. No victory levels can be achieved for the round by the defender. Applies both to Combat Rolls and Dodge Rolls if declared. Can not be applied when a Character can not solely focus on defending themselves, such as when they have Disadvantage to their Combat Rolls or Dodge Rolls. Examples include being Staggered, being attacked from outside a Grapple, getting up from being Prone, being Off Guard, Dashing, etc...

## Ranged vs Melee (Disadvantage)

When a melee combat roll is made towards a character within melee or reach range, the character has Disadvantage on ranged combat rolls versus the melee combat roll.

## Dash (2x Movement Speed)

Instead of engaging in a combat roll, a player can choose to focus purely on their movement in combat, doubling their movement speed. They can still Dodge.

## Stationary Shooting (Advantage) (Disadvantage to Dodge Rolls)

Remain stationary for an entire round to gain a more stable base for ranged attacks. Advantage on all of ranged attacks for that round, except against opponents engaging the character with a Melee or Reach Range combat roll. Due to being a stationary target, Disadvantage on Dodge Roll.

## Focused Shot (Advantage) (Disadvantage to Dodge Rolls)

This is an [Assist](./../GeneralRules/Assists.md), which is usually achieved with the Perception Core Skill.

While making a ranged attack, focus on a single opponent and target a weak point. Your Engageable Opponents is reduced to 1 for the turn.

## Charge (Advantage)

This is an [Assist](./../GeneralRules/Assists.md), which is usually achieved with the Athletics Core Skill.

If there is 10 ft between the character and opponent, they may add their momentum to their attack. This must be in a straight line, and once a charge is initiated as a portion of a character's movement, their directions must remain constant the entire round. Disadvantage to dodging ranged attacks.

## Brace (Advantage versus Charge)

This is an [Assist](./../GeneralRules/Assists.md), which is usually achieved with the Lift Core Skill.

A brace is a move purely to counter a charge. Character gains Advantage versus charging opponents and charging opponents lose their advantage. No movement can be used while bracing. Bracing uses the opponent's momentum against them, enabling a prepared defender to more easily stagger, trip or injure the charging opponent.

## High ground (Advantage)

Bonus received through achieving a height advantage against an opponent, IE standing on a table, riding on a mount, or attacking an opponent on the ground. High ground for ranged attacks, must have a more significant height differential than for melee attacks, such as shooting from a climbed tree or atop a castle wall.

## Off Guard (Disadvantage)

Penalty to combat rolls and dodge rolls received when a character is actively engaged in something else, IE exhausting their Engageable Opponents, picking a lock, dashing away, being distracted, etc.

## Sneak Attack (CL in lieu of defense roll)

An attack made while hidden that can't be defended against by the opponent. Usually proceeded by a Stealth Skill Check versus a Perception Skill Check. The Narrator will assign a CL for the attack. As an example, slitting someone's throat with a dagger is a CL 1, however, doing the same with a great sword would be far more difficult. Any wins achieved over the CL count towards the level of victory. Failing the CL or not fully incapacitating the opponent commences the next round of combat, where the opponent is then engaged.

## Cover

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.
There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.

### Half Cover: Minor Resistance

A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

### Three-quarters Cover: Serious Resistance

A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.

### Full Cover: Complete Resistance

A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.
