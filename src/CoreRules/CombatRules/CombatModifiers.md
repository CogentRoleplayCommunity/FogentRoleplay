# Combat Modifiers

## Defensive (Advantage) (no victory levels)

This is when a character purely focuses on defending themselves. No victory levels can be achieved for the round by the defender. Applies both to Combat Rolls, and Dodge Rolls if declared. Can not be applied while a player can not fully focus on defending themselves (Staggered, Prone, Flanked, Dashing, etc.)

## Ranged vs Melee (Disadvantage)

When a melee combat roll is made towards a character within melee or reach range, the character has disadvantage on ranged combat rolls versus the melee combat roll.

## Dash (2x Movement Speed)

Instead of engaging in a combat roll, a player can choose to focus purely on their movement in combat, doubling their movement speed. They can still Dodge.

## Charge (+1d6)

If there is 15 ft between the character and opponent, they may add their momentum to their attack. This must be in a straight line, and once a charge is initiated as a portion of movement, your directions must remain constant the entire round.

## Focused Shot (+1d6)

While making a ranged attack, remain still and focus on a single shot. Your Engageable Opponents is reduced to 1 for the turn. You can not move while making a focused shot and have disadvantage to Dodging. If the character is forced to Dodge before their combat roll, they do not benefit from focused.

## Brace (+2 wins versus charge)

A brace is a move purely to counter a charge. No movement can be used while bracing. Bracing uses the opponentâ€™s momentum against them, enabling a prepared defender to more easily stagger, trip or injure the charging opponent.

## High ground (Advantage)

Bonus received through achieving a height advantage against an opponent, IE standing on a table, riding on a mount, or attack an opponent the ground.

## Flank (Advantage)

Bonus received when attacking an opponent actively engaged in something else, IE exhausting an opponent 's Engageable Opponents within a single round, picking a lock, dashing away, etc.

## Off guard (CL in lieu of defense roll)

CL determined by Narrator IE, attacking a soldier from behind may require a successful Stealth check, then the attack (which they cannot defend against) will be a CL assigned by the Narrator, which the player will roll against with a normal combat roll (without a flanking bonus). Any wins achieved over the CL counts towards the level of victory. Failing the CL commences the next round of combat, where the opponent is then engaged.

## Incapacitated (Super Advantage)

If a character is incapacitated, they are held in place, tied up, or unconscious and therefore cannot fight back or defend themselves. Armor levels are disregarded if the attackers can narratively get around the armor easily. The CL a character must exceed to obtain ANY victory level against them is CL1.

## Cover

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.
There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.

### Half Cover: +2 Defense

A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

### Three-quarters Cover: +3 Defense

A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.

### Full Cover: Can't be engaged or engage in ranged combat

A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.
