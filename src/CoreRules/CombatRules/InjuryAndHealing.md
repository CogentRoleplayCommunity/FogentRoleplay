# Injury and Healing

## Injury

Injury is handled as part of the narrative with dice penalties being applied per injury to all a character's dice checks. A character is rendered [Incapacitated](./Conditions.md#incapacitated) once they've taken a summed 5 or above injury dice.

Typical "status effects" such as being poisoned, frostbitten, bleeding, madness, etc... are handled elegantly through the injury system. For instance, if you were dealt a Serious injury by mild poison mist, then narratively explain it as getting a large breath full. If the character instead was dealt a Serious injury by an extremely lethal poison mist, then narratively it would be explained as only getting a small whiff. The resulting dice penalty acts as your "status effect" debuffing your character until they are resolved. For instance, anti-venom might be able to remove the poison injury or warming up by a fire might reduce hypothermia from the cold.

# Healing

Since Injuries work on a narrative severity scale, so does the healing that can be performed. These could come from Magic or science-based medicine.
