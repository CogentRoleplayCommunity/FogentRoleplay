# Weapons

Examples of weapons include swords, bows, guns, or even a character's fists.

In order to make a combat roll, a character needs to specify what weapon they will be using. Weapons can dramatically improve the chances of getting more wins on a combat roll, make it possible to engage opponents at far distances, enable rapid engagement of multiple opponents, deal various types of damages which an opponents might be weak to, etc...

Below is a key to help you understand the weapon tables below.

##### Name

The name of a weapon is it's Weapon Type, followed by it's Handed Variation in parentheses, followed by it's Base Dice Tier Adjustment amount in parentheses.

For example, let's say we are making rapier sword for use in our game. Rapier's logically seem to be Medium Melee weapons. In regards which Handed Variations it gets, most rapier grips only include space for one hand, thus we only use the One-handed and Dual-wielded, and not Two-handed. Next, in regards to the Base Dice Tier Adjustment amounts, we note that rapiers were designed to favor the piercing rather than slashing. Thus, we could give a +2 Base Dice Tier Adjustment Amount when piercing with this sword.

Thus, our rapier would have the below weapons:

"Medium Pierce Melee (One-handed) (+2), Medium Pierce Melee (Dual-wielded) (+2), Medium Slash Melee (One-handed) (+0), Medium Slash Melee (Dual-wielded) (+0)"

##### Weapon Type

Just describes what type of weapon.

##### Base Dice Tier Adjustment

Adjusts the [Base Dice Tier](./../GeneralRules/BaseDiceTiers.md) by the amount specified. This generally is used to indicate the quality of the weapon in question. For instance a "Hand Crossbow (One-handed) (+1)" will have 1d8,2d6 as it's Base Dice. The table below only shows the +0 Base Dice Tier Adjustment amount for the sake of brevity.

##### Handed Variation

###### One-handed

The dice pool modifier added when wielding a weapon in one hand or equivalent appendage. This frees up the other hand to hold a shield, another weapon, an important item, etc...

###### Two-handed

The dice pool modifier added when wielding a weapon in two hands or equivalent appendages.

###### Dual-wielded

The dice pool modifier added when dual wielding a main weapon in one hand with an off-handed weapon in the other hand. Only weapons with the "Dual-wielded" handed variation are eligible for dual wielding. To dual wield, a character must have at least one skill point in both of the weapons held.

##### Dice Pool Mod

Represents the dice pool modification that a particular weapon gives you. The better the weapon is as a force multiplier, the larger the dice pool modification.

##### Penetration

The amount of Penetration a weapon adds to a characters combat roll. See [Penetration](./Defense.md#penetration) for more details.

##### Range

The distance at which a weapon can be used. See [Range](./Range.md) for more details.

##### Uses Per Round

The amount of times a weapon be used per round. See [Uses Per Round](./UsesPerRound.md) for more details.

##### Area Of Effect

The shape and amount of area a weapon attack creates. See [Area Of Effect](./AreaOfEffect.md) for more details.

##### Ammo Type And Ammo Per Use

The ammo type required to use the weapon and the amount of ammo consumed per use of the weapon. See [Ammo Type](./Ammunitions.md#ammo-type) for more details.

##### Damage Types

The types of Damage a weapon inflicts when dealing injuries.
