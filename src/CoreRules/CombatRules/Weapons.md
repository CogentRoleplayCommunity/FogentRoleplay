# Weapons

Examples of weapons include swords, bows, guns, or even a character's fists.

In order to make a combat roll, a character needs to specify what weapon they will be using. Weapons can dramatically improve the chances of getting more wins on a combat roll, but also how far away they can shoot something, how many opponents they can engage in a round, deal various types of damages, etc... Below is a key to help you understand the weapon tables below.

##### Weapon Base Dice Tier

All weapons have a [Base Dice Tier](./../GeneralRules/BaseDiceTiers.md), which measures the quality of the weapon, which is prefixed. For instance a "Quality Hand Crossbow" is a Hand Crossbow with 1d8,2d6 as it's Base Dice. If a Weapon omits it's Base Dice Tier prefix, assume it has a "Mundane" Base Dice Tier. All of the table below omit the Base Dice Tier prefix for the sake of brevity.

##### One Handed

The dice pool modifier added when wielding a weapon in one hand or equivalent appendage. This frees up the other hand to hold a shield, another weapon, an important item, etc...

##### Two Handed

The dice pool modifier added when wielding a weapon in two hands or equivalent appendages. For characters with Primal Melee weapons such as a Bite or Horns, denotes that the creature is wholly focused on those weapons.

##### Dual Wielded

The dice pool modifier added when dual wielding a main weapon in one hand with an off-handed weapon in the other hand. Only weapons with a Dual Wielded dice pool modifier are eligible for dual wielding. To dual wield, a character must have at least one skill point in both of the weapons held. Dual-wielding weapons that use Ammo doubles the Ammo used per opponent engaged.

##### Penetration

The amount of Penetration a weapon adds to a characters combat roll. See [Penetration](./Defense.md#penetration) for more details.

##### Range

The distance at which a weapon can be used. See [Range](./Range.md) for more details.

##### Uses Per Round

The amount of times a weapon be used per round. See [Uses Per Round](./UsesPerRound.md) for more details.

##### Area Of Effect

The shape and amount of area a weapon attack creates. See [Area Of Effect](./AreaOfEffect.md) for more details.

##### Ammo Type

The ammo type required to use the weapon. See [Ammo Type](./Ammunitions.md#ammo-type) for more details.

##### Ammo per Use

The amount of Ammo consumed per use of the weapon.

##### Damage Types

The types of Damage a weapon inflicts when dealing injuries.

## Reach Melee

The Narrator is free to negate all dice bonuses if they feel the reach weapon wouldn't work as effectively due to narrow confines such as an alleyway or hallway. Since these are battlefield weapons, these would most certainly draw the attention of guards and towns folks. Walking around with these would be equivalent to walking around with an assault rifle in modern times.
