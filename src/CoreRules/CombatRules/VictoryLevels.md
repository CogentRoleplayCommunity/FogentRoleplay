# Victory Levels

- Victory Levels from Physical or Bodily damage can be reduced equal to the amount of STR a character has per combat encounter. If STR is negative, the level of Victory increases by 1.
- Victory levels from Mental or Soul damage can be reduced equal to the amount of INT a character has per combat encounter. If INT is negative, the level of Victory increases by 1.
- Any combination of lower Victory Level outcomes is possible as long as they sum up to be less than or equal to the Victory Level achieved. For instance, with a Level 2 victory, a character could perform both a Stagger and a Minor Injury against there opponent.
- It is mandatory that for a character to deal any Victory Level outcome, whomever control's said character must describe in awesome detail how they are preforming said Victory Level outcome. Creativity is encouraged!

## Level 1 victory

### Minor Injury

-1d to STR/RFX/INT governed Dice Pools. Will naturally heal over the next few days, or faster if treated actively.

### Stagger

The opponent gains the [Staggered](./Conditions.md#staggered) condition until the end of the next round.

This could be sand thrown in a character's face, being shoulder-checked, or losing their footing.

### Shove

The opponent is shoved in the desired direction.

The character can either roll a Lift check or take the average amount of Wins rounded down. If a character is using magic, they may use a Magic Skill instead of Lift, assuming the magic could shove someone. For each win achieved, a character can shove another character 5 feet in a straight line. For each size category the opponent is smaller than you, double the distance. For each size category, the opponent is larger than you, half the distance. The Narrator can change this distance based on unusual circumstances (i.e. humanoid-sized creature weighs as much as a Large sized creature as it is made of pure metal/stone).

### Grapple

Enter/exit a Grapple. If entering into a Grapple, apply the [Grappled](./Conditions.md#grappled) condition to both you and your opponent. Exiting a Grapple can also be accomplished with a Dodge roll.

### Grapple Move

While in a grapple, you can move your opponent.

The character can either roll a Lift check or take the average amount of wins rounded down. If a character is using magic, they may use a Magic Skill instead of Lift, assuming the magic could grapple someone. For each win achieved, a character can Move another character 10 feet. For each size category the opponent is smaller than you, double the distance. For each Size the opponent is larger than you, half the distance. If your character is required to move during the move, you can not exceed your normal amount of movement for that round. The Narrator can change this distance based on unusual circumstances (i.e. humanoid-sized creature weighs as much as a Large sized creature as it is made of pure metal/stone).

## Level 2 victory

### Medium Injury

-2d to STR/RFX/INT governed Dice Pools. Must be treated relatively soon otherwise further penalties may apply such as infection.

### Disarm

The opponent loses their weapon. If an opponent is dual-wielding, they will only lose one of their weapons.

#### Grapple Disarm

Once already in a Grapple, as part of their declaration phase a character can declare they are attempting a Grapple Disarm to disarm their opponent. The character attempting the Grapple Disarm must be unarmed. They gain Advantage to Unarmed combats roll versus the armed grappled opponent. The armed opponent gains Disadvantage on their combat roll versus the character that is grappling them. The character attempting the Grapple Disarm may only take the Disarm Level 2 Victory (this means they cannot delegate their attack to inflict an injury or execute a trip regardless of how high the victory achieved.)

## Level 3 victory

### Serious Injury

-3d to STR/RFX/INT governed Dice Pools.  The character will die in time if the wound is untreated.

### Trip

The opponent gains the [Prone](./Conditions.md#prone) condition.

A character can declare they are attempting to get up on a round they start prone. Getting up requires the downed opponent to use their entire movement speed. They can regain their footing and remove the Prone condition at the end of the round they were getting up.

Instead of getting up, a character can remain prone and crawl. They use their Climb Combat Speed to crawl instead of their movement speed.

## Level 4 Victory

### Fatal Injury

-4d to STR/RFX/INT governed Dice Pools. Gains the [Incapacitated](./Conditions.md#incapacitated) condition and will die very soon if untreated.

### Dismember

Remove an arm or leg, which also gives a Serious Injury to the opponent. Not available to ranged combat rolls unless there is a narrative explanation of how a ranged attack could dismember (magic, explosive projectiles, etc...).

### Render Unconscious

Opponent gains the [Unconscious](./Conditions.md#unconscious) condition such as from head trauma, blood chokes, etc. Opponent receives a Medium Injury.

## Level 5 victory and higher

### Death Blow

-5d to STR/RFX/INT governed Dice Pools. Instantly killed.
