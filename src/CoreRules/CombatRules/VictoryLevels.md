## Level 1 victory

### Minor Injury

–1 dice to all dice checks but will naturally heal over the next few days, or faster if treated actively.

### Stagger

Opponent gains the Staggered combat modifier. This could be sand thrown in a character face, being shoulder checked, or losing their footing. The opponent has disadvantage on rolls until the end of the next round. Movement speed is halved while staggered. The opponent can not benefit from the Defensive modifier while staggered as they can't fully focus on defending themselves.

### Shove

Shove an enemy in a desired direction. Base 5 feet of shoving. Each point in STR gains 5 feet. Each point in Lift gains 2.5 feet. For each size category the opponent is smaller than you, double the distance of the shove. For each size category the opponent is larger than you, half the distance. Narrator's discretion to change this distance (i.e. humanoid sized creature weighs as much as a Large category creature as it is made of pure metal/stone).

### Close Combat

Enter/exit close combat. The fight is so close in physical proximity that the character's bodies are pressed up against each other in a grapple or wrestle. A character using a medium (or larger) weapon is considered unarmed. Injury reduction from armor is not applicable while in close combat. Medium weapons can be used in close combat against reach weapons.

The initiator of close combat can release the grapple at any time. Not available to ranged combat rolls.

#### Move

As part of entering into close quarters combat or already being in close quarters combat, you can move your opponent. The Narrator will give a challenge level given their size and weight.

Base 10 feet of moving. Each point in STR gains 10 feet. Each point in Lift gains 5 feet. For each size category the opponent is smaller than you, double the move distance. For each size category the opponent is larger than you, half the distance. Narrator's discretion to change this distance (i.e. humanoid sized creature weighs as much as a Large category creature as it is made of pure metal/stone).

If your character is required to move during the move, you can not exceed your normal amount of movement for that round.

#### Disarming

Can be used in close combat and receives bonus in disarming actions. A player must be in close combat to disarm another player while being unarmed.

Once in close combat, if declaring to attempt a disarm before the round begins, the player receives +4d6 in their attack roll but the roll cannot be used for any victory (this means they cannot delegate their attack to inflict an injury or execute a trip regardless of how high the victory achieved.)

## Level 2 victory

### Medium injury

-2 dice to all dice checks and must be treated relatively soon, otherwise further penalties may apply such as infection.

### Disarm

Opponent loses their weapon. If an opponent is dual wielding, they will only lose one of their weapons.

## Level 3 victory

### Serious injury

–3 dice to all dice checks and the character will die in time if the wound is untreated.

### Trip

Opponent is rendered prone. The opponent has disadvantage on rolls until they get up. Melee attacks made against the downed opponent are at advantage.

A character can declare they are attempting to get up on a round they start prone. While getting up, the opponents movement speed is 0. They are able to regain their footing and remove the prone effect at the end of the round they were getting up. The opponent can not benefit from the Defensive modifier while getting up as they can't fully focus on defending themselves.

Instead of getting up, a character can remain prone. They use their climb speed to crawl instead of their movement speed.

## Level 4 Victory

### Fatal injury

–4 dice to all dice checks, incapacitated, and will die very soon if untreated.

### Dismember

Remove an arm or leg, which also gives a Serious Injury to the opponent. Not available to ranged combat rolls unless their is a narrative explanation how a ranged attack could dismember (magic, explosive projectiles, ect...).

### Render Unconscious

Opponent is rendered unconscious by head trauma, blood chokes, etc. Opponent receives a Medium Injury.

## Level 5 victory and higher

### Death blow

An instant kill.
