# Dodge Roll

When an combat roll is made against a character who is not returning fire or attacking back, the defender can make an reactive Acrobatics Roll vs the attacker's Combat Roll. Any levels over the defender's Dodge wins count as victories for the attacker. The Dodge Roll counts for the entire round. A Combat Roll and Dodge Roll can both be made in a round. If the character takes the Defensive combat modifier, then it is also applied.

## Engageable Opponents for Dodge Rolls

Dodge Rolls have an EO (Engageable Opponnets) of Rapid. Each Dodge uses up 1 engageable opponnet for that round. If a combat roll and dodge roll are made on the same round, a character's EO is the lesser between the two. Character's can abstain from dodging to save thier EO, leaving only their defense to protect them for the incoming attack.

For example, a character has 7d6 with their light bow combat and 6d6 with their Dodge roll. The light bows EO is Quick, resulting in 2 EO for that combat roll. Their Dodge roll has an EO of Rapid, resulting in 3 EO. If in a round of combat this character is shooting their bow and dodging, their engageable opponents would be 2. If they were only shooting their bow, 2 EO. Lastly, if they were only Dodging, 3 EO.

Example 1:

Our example character above decides he is shooting Goblin 1. Goblin 2 and Goblin 3 have higher turn order, declaring they are shooting our example character. The Action Phase start, with Goblin 2 and Goblin 3 loosing their arrows. Our example character reflexively dodges the incoming goblin arrows, using up 2 EO. When it is their turn to shoot at Goblin 1, they don't have the required EO to engage a target this round.

Example 2: 

Our example character above decides he is shooting Goblin 1. Goblin 2 has higher turn order, declaring they are shooting our example character. The Action Phase start, with Goblin 2 loosing their arrow. Our example character reflexively dodges the incoming goblin arrow, using up 1 EO. When it is their turn to shoot at Goblin 1, loose their arrow at Goblin 1, using thier 1 and last engageable opponent for that round.
