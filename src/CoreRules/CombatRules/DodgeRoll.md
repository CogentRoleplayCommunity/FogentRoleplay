# Dodge Roll

When an combat roll is made against a character who is not returning fire or attacking back, the defender can make an reactive Acrobatics Roll vs the attacker's Combat Roll. Any levels over the defender's Dodge wins count as victories for the attacker. The Dodge Roll counts for the entire round. A Combat Roll and Dodge Roll can both be made in a round. If the character takes the Defensive combat modifier, then it is also applied.
