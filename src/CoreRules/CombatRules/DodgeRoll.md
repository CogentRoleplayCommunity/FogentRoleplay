# Dodge Roll

When an combat roll is made against a character who is not capable of making an opposing combat roll, the defender can make an Acrobatics Roll vs the attacker's Combat Roll. This is an assumed reflexive action, IE a character could as part of the Declaration Phase declare"... and I'll try to dodge any thing being shot at me" every round. Any levels over the defender's Dodge Roll wins count as victories for the attacker. A Combat Roll and Dodge Roll can both be made in a round.
