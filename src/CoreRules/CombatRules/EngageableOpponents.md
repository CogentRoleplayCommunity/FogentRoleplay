# Engageable Opponents

Engageable Opponents represent the number of opponents that can be fought in a certain round. Each opponent engaged with a combat roll cost one engageable opponent for that round. If a character's engageable opponents are exceeded, they gain the [Off Guard](./CombatModifiers.md#off-guard-disadvantage) Combat Modifier and are unable to achieve Victory Levels for the remainder of the round.

## Engageable Opponents Calculations

The amount of opponents a character can engage in a round is calculated below:

### Engageable Opponent calculation resulting in 0

If a roll's calculation results in less than a 0, the following rules apply.

On a round where you roll IS prepared (i.e. your Heavy Crossbow is loaded) you can engage 1 opponent.

On a round where your roll is NOT prepared (i.e. your Heavy Crossbow is empty), you must spend 1 round reloading/preparing in order to use this roll again, during which the [Off Guard](./CombatModifiers.md#off-guard-disadvantage) Combat Modifier is gained. If engaged during this time characters can still attempt to dodge while preparing/reloading.

## Set Engageable Opponents
