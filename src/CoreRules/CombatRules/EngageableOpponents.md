# Engageable Opponents

Engageable Opponents represent the number of opponents that can be engaged with a combat roll for that round. If a combat roll's Engageable Opponents are exceeded, then the character gains the [Off Guard](./CombatModifiers.md#off-guard-disadvantage) Combat Modifier and are unable to achieve Victory Levels for the remainder of the round.

## Engageable Opponents Calculations

The amount of opponents a character can engage in a round is calculated using the following equation:

( (Number of Skill Dice) + (Dice Amount Adjustment) )/ (Divisor), rounded down to the nearest whole number only if above 1, to a maximum of (Max EO)

|      Name      | Divisor | Dice Amount Adjustment | Max EO |
| :------------: | :-----: | :--------------------: | :----: |
|     Rapid     |    1    |           0           |  None  |
|  Reach Swift  |    2    |           2           |  None  |
|     Swift     |    2    |           0           |  None  |
|     Quick     |    3    |           0           |  None  |
|     Steady     |    4    |           0           |  None  |
|     Paced     |    5    |           0           |  None  |
|      Slow      |    6    |           0           |  None  |
| Extremely Slow |    8    |           0           |  None  |
| Painfully Slow |   16   |           0           |  None  |

For example, if a character had 7 dice in their governing skill dice pool with an Engageable Opponents types of Quick, 7 divided by 3 is 2.333, which rounded down is 2. So they would have 2 Engageable Opponents for that combat roll within the round.

### Engageable Opponent calculation resulting in less than 1

On a round where a weapon IS prepared (i.e. your Heavy Crossbow is loaded, etc...) 1 opponent can be engaged.

On a round where a weapon is NOT prepared (i.e. your Heavy Crossbow is empty, etc...), if the Engageable Opponents Calculation result is greater than or equal to 0.5 and less than 1, 1 round must be spend reloading/preparing in order to use the weapon again. If the result is greater than 0 and less 0.5, your character must spend 2 rounds reloading/preparing. While reloading/preparing the [Off Guard](./CombatModifiers.md#off-guard-disadvantage) Combat Modifier is gained. If engaged during this time characters can still attempt to dodge while preparing/reloading.

### Engageable Opponents if character is using multiple loaded weapons

If characters have loaded weapons (for instance loaded muzzle loading firearms) within easy access to themselves, they can forgo loading, and use a faster EO type that the Narrator decides. For instance, for muzzle loading pistols being drawn from a chest rig, "Swift" seems like a reasonable Engageable Opponents type.
