# Engageable Opponents

The amount of opponents a character can engage in a round is calculated below.

- Combat modifiers can be factored into these equations.
- If a ranged calculation results in less than a 1, then the character can only fire once per round if the weapon/spell is loaded/prepared and must spend their next round reloading/preparing with no movement.
