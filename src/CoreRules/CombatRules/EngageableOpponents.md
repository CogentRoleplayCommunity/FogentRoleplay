# Engageable Opponents

Engageable Opponents represent the number of opponents that can be fought in a certain round. Each opponent engaged with a combat roll cost one engageable opponent for that round. If a character's engageable opponents are exceeded, they gain the [Off Guard](./CombatModifiers.md#off-guard-disadvantage) Combat Modifier and are unable to achieve Victory Levels for the remainder of the round.

## Engageable Opponents Calculations

The amount of opponents a character can engage in a round is calculated below:

| Engageable Opponents Type |                Calculation                |
| :-----------------------: | :----------------------------------------: |
|           Rapid           |        (Combat Roll)/2 rounded down        |
|           Quick           |        (Combat Roll)/3 rounded down        |
|         Standard         |        (Combat Roll)/4 rounded down        |
|           Slow           |        (Combat Roll)/5 rounded down        |
|          Loading          |        (Combat Roll)/6 rounded down        |
|      Complex Loading      |       (Combat Roll)/10 rounded down       |
|        Rapid Max 2        | (Combat Roll)/2 rounded down, maximum of 2 |

### Engageable Opponent calculation resulting in 0

If a roll's calculation results in less than a 0, the following rules apply.

On a round where you roll IS prepared (i.e. your Heavy Crossbow is loaded) you can engage 1 opponent.

On a round where your roll is NOT prepared (i.e. your Heavy Crossbow is empty), you must spend 1 round reloading/preparing in order to use this roll again, during which the [Off Guard](./CombatModifiers.md#off-guard-disadvantage) Combat Modifier is gained. If engaged during this time characters can still attempt to dodge while preparing/reloading.

## Set Engageable Opponents
