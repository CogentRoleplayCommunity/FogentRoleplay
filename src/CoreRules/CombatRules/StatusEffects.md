## Status Effects

Typical status effects such as being poisoned, frostbitten, bleeding, madness, etc... are handled elegantly through the injury system. For instance, if you were dealt a Serious injury by mild poison mist, then narratively explain it as getting a large breath full. If the character instead was dealt a Serious injury by an extremely lethal poison mist, then narratively it would be explained as only getting a small whiff.

The resulting dice penalty acts as your status effect debuffing your character until they are resolved. For instance, anti-venom might be able to remove the poison injury or warming up by a fire might reduce frostbite from cold damage.
