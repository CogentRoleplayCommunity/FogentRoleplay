## Status Effects

Typical status effects such as being poisoned, frostbitten, bleeding, madness, ect... are handled elegantly though the injury system. For instance, if you were dealt a Serious injury by mild poison mist, than narratively explain it as a getting a large breath full. If the character instead was dealt a Serious injury by an extremely lethal poison mist, than narratively it would be explained as only getting a small whiff.

The resulting dice penalty act as your status effect debuffing your character until they are resolved. For instance, anti venom might be able to remove the poison injury or warming up by a fire might reduce frostbite from cold damage.
