# Combat Rounds

Combat is run in a Round by Round format. Each character can perform 1 combat roll within a round (though additional things like climbing as part of your movement or reactively dodging arrows) with liberties in regard to the narrative flow of the game. For instance it doesn't take an action to shout out something to another character while fighting a monster, though it would take a round to explain something complicated.

Actions in combat rounds are not solely movements and attacks. A combat action can really be anything a person could do within a few seconds, such as turning over a table with there weapon, swinging from a chandelier, or dropping a boulder onto an enemy. The Narrative flow you develop while playing will guide you in what the players can do in game, and how long it will take to do it.

## Round Order

Every action within Round by Round conflicts happen almost at the same time or in direct succession of one another. This means that one character's action is NOT explicitly followed by another character's action. It should be considered as everything happening together.

To make sense of this potential 'chaos', there is a declaration phase and a performance phase.

### Declaration Phase

The Character with lowest reflex declares what they are doing first. That might seem odd as you could think characters with higher REF should get to move first, but this is the declaration phase, no one is moving yet. If two Characters have the same REF, they each roll a D6 (though d20s work better), where the highest resulting roll gets to declare later for the rest of the combat encounter.

Players who declare LATER hold the upper hand in combat.

Once a player has declared what they are going to perform, they cannot change their mind. They are locked into performing that action in this round. The players who declare after another can chose an action that counters or complements the declared action of another character.

This means that characters with highest Reflex can see or react to what their opponents are going to do.

### Action Phase

Once all characters have declared their action, the order reverse starting with person with the highest reflex acting first. Though things mostly happen simultaneously within the round, it's sometimes important to know which blade landed before another, or who managed to perform their action a little bit faster than another. In these situations, the character with higher reflex will always win.

## Keep your Combat Rolls, Dodge Rolls, and Assist Rolls!

Combat Rolls, Dodge Rolls, Assists Rolls, etc... should be held onto during combat after they've been rolled. This is to remember your current victory levels for the round. This is also in case your character loses dice due to injury or they gain disadvantage/advantage in that round, which will effect the already rolled dice pool.

### Removing Dice to an already rolled Dice Pool

Whenever losing dice of the same kind, always remove dice from left to right. This is to leave it up to chance if they dice they lost that round punishes or is indifferent to their combat roll for that round. With physical dice, you can just roughly straighten out the dice and begin removing in that order.

### Applying Disadvantage/Advantage to an already rolled Dice Pool

If your character gains a disadvantage (often the result of a stagger or being knocked prone) or advantage (you engage a prone opponent as your second target with a melee weapon) after you've already rolled a dice pool that round (combat roll dice pool, dodge dice pool, ect...), you will retroactively apply said disadvantage/advantage to your those dice pools. This could turn some dice that were wins into fails and vice versa.
