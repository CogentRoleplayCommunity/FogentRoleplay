# Battlemap Combat

Combat takes places on grided battle maps, with each square representing a 5 ft by 5 ft square.

## Movement

Different creatures get different movements speeds in combat.

## Difficult Terrain

Steep mountains, ice-covered ground, swamps, etc. are difficult terrain. It takes twice the movement to move through these terrains (10 feet instead of 5 feet).

## Mounts in combat

When riding a mount in combat, the rider's acrobatics skill replaces their mounts skill level for their movement speed calculation capped by the mounts original skill level.

For instance, a riding horse has a the Fast 4-Legged Movement Speed and a level 3 skill in Athletics. A level 3 in athletics would typically give +15 feet (80 feet total) of movement in combat. When his master, who has a level 0 in acrobatics, decides to ride him, his masters level 0 in acrobatics is used for their combined movement speed giving +0 feet (65 feet total) of movement in combat. However, when a master rider who has a level 4 in Acrobatics, is riding the horse, they still only gain +15 feet (80 feet total) since the rider's skill is capped by the horse level 3 in Athletics.

Additionally, when a mounted character or their mount takes an injury in combat, an Acrobatic check equivalent to the injury level must be succeeded to stay on horseback, else they are knocked off.
