# Range

Each Range represents a calculation which given the number of dice in a Skill Dice Pool calculates the Effective Range, Ineffective Range, and Max Range. Therefor, as a character's Weapon/Magic Skill improves, so does the range at which it can be used.

Effective Range, Ineffective Range, and Max Range are usually represented on a character sheet in the "(Effective Range)/(Ineffective Range)/(Max Range)" format. For example, "100/200/400" translates to an Effective Range of 100 ft, an Ineffective Range of 200 ft, and a Max Range of 400 ft.

## Effective Range

The distance up to which you are effective.

Effective Range = (Effective Range Per Dice) * (Number of Skill Dice), rounded down to the nearest multipe of 5.

From 0 ft up to the Effective Range, Disadvantage is NOT gained on Dice Pool the skill is being used in.

## Ineffective Range

It is the distance up to which your effectiveness is only partially degraded.

Ineffective Range = (Effective Range) * 2.

Past the Effective Range and up to the Ineffective Range, Disadvantage is gained on Dice Pool the skill is being used in.

## Max Range

It is the maximum distance that can be targeted with the characters current skill.

Max Range = (Effective Range) * 4.

Past the Ineffective Range up to the Max Range, Super Disadvantage is gained on Dice Pool the skill is being used in.
