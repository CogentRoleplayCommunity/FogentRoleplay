# Range

Each Range represents a calculation which given the number of dice of a Weapon/Magic Skill Dice Pool calculates the Effective Range, Ineffective Range, and Max Range. Therefor, as a character's Weapon/Magic Skill improves, so does the range at which it can be used.

Effective Range, Ineffective Range, and Max Range are usually represented on a character sheet in the "(Effective Range)/(Ineffective Range)/(Max Range)" format. For example, "100/200/400" translates to an Effective Range of 100 ft, an Ineffective Range of 200 ft, and a Max Range of 400 ft.

## Effective Range

Effective Range is equal to the result of an Effective Range Calculation. It is the distance up to which you are effective.

From 0 ft up to the Effective Range, Disadvantage is NOT gained on Dice Pool the skill is being used in.

## Ineffective Range

Ineffective Range is equal to double your Effective Range. It is the distance up to which your effectiveness is only partially degraded.

Past the Effective Range and up to the Ineffective Range, Disadvantage is gained on Dice Pool the skill is being used in.

## Max Range

Max Range is equal to quadruple your Effective Range. It is the maximum distance that can be targeted with the characters current skill.

Past the Ineffective Range up to the Max Range, Super Disadvantage is gained on Dice Pool the skill is being used in.
