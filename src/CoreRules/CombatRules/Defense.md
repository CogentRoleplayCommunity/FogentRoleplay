# Defense

Depending on the damage type, different types of defense can be used to resist injuries. A character can then reduce a physical injury level by the equivalent amount of defense they have to that damage type. The only way to injure an opponent with a specific defense is to exceed, or bypass it.

## Physical Defense

A measure of a character's resistance to all physical injuries. A character can wear two pieces of armor in the same category, such as wearing a gambeson under chain mail or a breastplate, which was most certainly done in history. In these circumstances the most efficient ways of defeating a person in armor is grappling them or tripping them and holding them down, just like in real life.

If a combat roll has a physical damage type and a damage type that would require an Bodily, Mental, or Spiritual defense roll, than since it is combine with the physical attack it is only versus physical defense. An example would be poison applied to the blade of a weapon.

- Physical Defense level = sum of all armor's defense levels rounded down

### Physical Defense from Shields
