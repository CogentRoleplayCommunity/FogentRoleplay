# Penetration

The only way to injure an opponent with a specific defense is to exceed or penetrate it.

Penetration represents a combat roll's ability to mitigate the opponent's defense. While dealing with an injury, you may reduce your opponent's Defense level by your combat roll's Penetration before calculating injury.

For penetration versus Physical Defense, primarily being armor, weapons with strong penetration include bludgeoning weapons such as a mace or war hammer, which historically were one of the primary ways of defeating heavy armor. To a lesser extent, thrusting weapons such as daggers or spears also have decent penetration versus physical defense, as they can be used to thrust into weak points in armor. Slashing swords would have some of the worst penetration, as it is highly unlikely to be able to slice through the armor.

For penetration versus Bodily, Mental, and Soul Defense, Penetration represents the attack's effect being harder to resist. For instance, it is far easier to resist taking injury from a single poison bolt versus being covered in a poison mist area of effect.
