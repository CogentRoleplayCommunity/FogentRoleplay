# Weapon Combat Skills

A Weapon Combat Skill covers the use of a group of similar weapons. The tables over on the [Weapons](./Weapons.md) page show which weapons are group under which Weapon Combat Skills. For instance, the "Medium Melee" Weapon Combat Skill covers the use of "Medium Hafted", "Medium Sword", and "Medium Spear".

All Weapon Combat Skills have the governing attributes of STR, RFX, and INT. This is to reflect that the stronger, faster, and smarter a character is, the more lethal they are in combat regardless of the weapon. A STR character hits harder, is tougher, and is more conditioned for combat. A RFX character hits faster and is harder to pin down. An INT character hits smarter and uses tactics. It is the player's/narrator's job to flavor their attacks to reflect how they are leveraging their innate attributes as they fight.

## Weapon Combat Skill Transfer

There is obviously overlap certain Weapon Combat Skills. For melee Weapon Combat Skills, weapon reach, footwork, and the biomechanics of swinging a weapon have some overlap. For ranged Weapon Combat Skills, having a proper base, judging the distance, leading your targets, aiming and releasing the projectile smoothly are examples of the overlap. Narrators should allow a character to gain Weapon Combat Skills, though of a lesser level, in similar Weapon Combat Skills in regards to size and function. This not only allows characters to experiment with new weapons but also makes narrative sense.

Starting with the weapon skill your character currently possesses, each horizontal (right and left on the table) or vertical (up and down on the table) jump is -1 reduction to the skill you've moved to. When moving horizontally within a Size type, you may loop around the other side of the table as if it were right beside it. You cannot go below 0 on a combat skill for either melee or ranged weapons via the table below.

### Respecing Combat Skills

Since certain weapon sizes provide more combat skill transfer than others, it is intend for the narrator to allow rebalancing skill point investments as to not waste skill levels as long as all previously know skills maintain they're skill level.

For example, a character has just been given 1 skill point to spend and has a level 3 in Small Blade. They wish to invest their skill point into the Medium Sword skill to try a new magic sword they found. Since they have a 3 in Small Blade already, by the Weapon Combat Skill Transfer rules they have a level 2 in Medium Sword. If they were to invest their skill point into Medium Sword to bring it to level 3, they are technically wasting skill points as had they from the start only invested the 3 skill points from Small Blade into Medium sword, with the addition of the unspent skill point, they'd have a level 4 in Medium sword, which would also give them a level 3 in Small Blade. Instead of wasting skill points, they can take the 3 skill points from Small Blade and the 1 unspent skill point and spend it on bring Medium sword to level 4. Since having a level 4 in Medium Sword gives a level 3 in Small Blade, nothing has changed in Small Blade.
