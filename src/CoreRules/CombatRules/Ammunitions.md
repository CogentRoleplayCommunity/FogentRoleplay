# Ammunitions

## Ammo Type

Ammo Type determines the resource a weapon uses to operate.

## Dice Pool Mod

Represent either an addition or subtraction of dice to the Combat Roll Dice Pool in which this Ammo is being used. This is to represent ammunition types that warrant a change effectiveness. For instance, a bomb arrow is significantly more dangerous than a Standard Light Arrow, so it would receive additional dice. However, a blunted practice arrow (such as the comical boxing glove arrow) is significantly less dangerous than a Standard Light Arrow, so it would lose dice.

## Base Dice Tier Adjustment

Alters a combat rolls base dice tier. For instance, if a Mundane Light Bow (Level 0, or as dice 3d6) were to use a Survival Light Arrow which has a -1 Base Dice Tier Adjustment, then the resulting combat roll would use 1d4,2d6 base dice tier (Level -1). If instead a Standard Light Arrow were used, the resulting combat roll would use 3d6 base dice tier (Level 0).

## Penetration

Additional Penetration from the Ammo. Ammo Penetration is added to Weapon Penetration results in the total Penetration for the Combat Roll.

## Range

Ammo can have a Range that overrides the Weapon's Range that it is used with. This can represent self propelled made projectiles or high pressure ballistic ammunition. If a Ammo Range is "None", then default to the Weapon's Range.

## Damage Types

Damage Types inflicted by the Ammo.

## Area Of Effect

Ammo can have an Area Of Effect that overrides the Weapon's Area Of Effect that it is used with. This can represent a bomb arrow or an explosive projectile. If a Ammo Area Of Effect is "None", then default to the Weapon's Area Of Effect.
