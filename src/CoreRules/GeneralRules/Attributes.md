# Attributes

Attributes represent the innate characteristics of a character. An attribute can go from level -2 to level 5. Each level corresponds with a narrative significance.

| Attribute Level |                      Narrative Meaning                      |
| :-------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------: |
|       -2       |            Painfully lacking in the attribute.            |
|       -1       |            Below an average person in our world.            |
|        0        |               An average person in our world.               |
|        1        |              Professional or naturally gifted.              |
|        2        | Elite or 'world-class'. Peak of real world human potential. |
|        3        |                Meta-human or genetic anomaly                |
|        4        |                        Demigod like                        |
|        5        |                Peak achievable or god like.                |

## Strength (STR)

Represents your character's innate muscle strength, bone density, tendon strength, physical durability, etc...

| Attribute Level |            Narrative Meaning            |
| :-------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|       -2       |                A squirrel                |
|       -1       |   Below an average person in our world   |
|        0        |      An average person in our world      |
|        1        |      Professional soldier or knight      |
|        2        | World's strongest man champion or Batman |
|        3        |     Bear, Ogre, or Captain America     |
|        4        |                 Hercules                 |
|        5        |                 Superman                 |

STR has the following effects:

- STR is factored into all STR Governed skills (Athletics, Endurance, Climb, Lift, etc...). Greater STR can help a character move more in a combat round and carry heavier gear without being penalized.
- STR is a character's physical and bodily durability. In combat, for every point in STR a character can reduce a victory level achieved against them from physical (bludgeon, slash, pierce, etc...) or bodily (poisons, cold, etc...) damage types once every combat encounter. Outside of combat, for every point in STR a character can reduce a physical or bodily damage type injury against them as many times as they want, granted there is a couple minutes of respite between each injury.

## Reflex (RFX)

Represents your reflexes, reaction speed, nervous system, fine motor control, nimbleness, agility, quickness...

| Attribute Level |                 Narrative Meaning                 |
| :-------------: | :-----------------------------------------------: |
|       -2       |                  A sea cucumber                  |
|       -1       |       Below an average person in our world       |
|        0        |          An average person in our world          |
|        1        | Professional thief, parkourist, or circus acrobat |
|        2        |    Gold medal gymnast or master martial artist    |
|        3        |                      Legolas                      |
|        4        |                     Spiderman                     |
|        5        |                The Flash or Hermes                |

RFX has the following effects:

- RFX is factored into all RFX-governed skills (Dexterity, Perception, Sleight of Hand, Stealth, etc...).
- As combat is conducted in a round-by-round format, the player with the highest RFX gets priority in that round.
- RFX allows characters to move before slower characters and increases all Combat Speeds.

|        0        |                    An average person in our world                    |

INT has the following effects:

- INT is factored into all INT Governed skills (General Knowledge, Survival, Willpower, Communication, etc...).
- For every point in INT the player receives 3 additional skill points to spend.
- INT is a character's soul and mental durability. In combat, for every point in INT a character can reduce a victory level achieved against them from soul (spiritual) or mental (psychic) damage types once every combat encounter. Outside of combat, for every point in INT a character can reduce a soul or mental damage type injury against them as many times as they want, granted there is a couple minutes of respite between each injury.

## Common Questions

### Why is there no Charisma stat

Intelligence governs the "Communications" skill which is essentially your classical charisma stat. The reality is that being smarter makes you a better communicator. Verbal IQ is one of the components of an IQ test for a reason. Also, emotional intelligence doesn't exist. It is pseudo-science and is mistakenly taken as trait agreeableness (Big 5 personality traits).
