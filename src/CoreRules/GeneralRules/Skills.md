## Skill Specialty

Once a dice pool for a given skill check is equal to or greater than 8 you are considered a specialist in that skill. If you are a specialist for a skill, when asked to make a check for that skill with a Challenge Level of 3 or less, you automatically pass if all of the following are true.

- You are not under duress (No time pressure, no outside influences or aggression such as combat.)
- The check is not a contested check.
- The check is not a reflexive action.

## Multiple Character skill check

Multiple characters may contribute to the same skill check. The narrator should than evaluate the challenge level in the context of if multiple characters where performing it. All characters make their skill check, from which the average is taken. The average will then determine success or failure.

### Example

A character wants to pick up an entire sturdy couch by themselves, and take it up a flight of stairs.

The narrator assigns this a Specialized task (CL 3), not only for the weigh of the couch, but for how cumbersome it is for one person. The character get 2 win on their Lift check. They are not able to get the couch up the stairs.

In a parallel dimension, 2 characters decide to pick up the couch. The narrator assigns this a Common task (CL 1) since people do this every day. The two characters both roll their Lift check. One gets 2 wins and the other gets 1 win. The average is 1.5, which is rounded down to 1. They are able to move the couch up the stairs.
