A character wants to pick up an entire sturdy couch by themselves, and take it up a flight of stairs.

The narrator assigns this a Specialized task (CL 3), not only for the weigh of the couch, but for how cumbersome it is for one person. The character get 2 win on their Lift check. They are not able to get the couch up the stairs.

In a parallel dimension, 2 characters decide to pick up the couch. The narrator assigns this a Common task (CL 1) since people do this every day. The two characters both roll their Lift check. One gets 2 wins and the other gets 1 win. The average is 1.5, which is rounded down to 1. They are able to move the couch up the stairs.
