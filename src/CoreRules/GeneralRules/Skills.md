# Skills

Skills represent the proficiency of certain tasks a character can perform.

## Skill Levels

Skill Level measures how good a character is at a specific skill. Skill Level ranges from level -1 to level 5.

## Skill Specialty

Once a dice pool for a given skill check is equal to or greater than 8 dice you are considered a specialist in that skill. If you are a specialist for a skill, when asked to make a check for that skill with a Challenge Level of 3 or less, you automatically pass if all of the following are true.

- You are not under duress (No time pressure, no outside influences or aggression such as combat.)
- The check is not contested.
- The check is not a reflexive action.

## Multiple Character skill check

Multiple characters may contribute to the same skill check. The Narrator should then evaluate the Challenge Level in the context of if multiple characters were performing it. All characters make their skill check, from which the average is taken, always rounding down to the nearest whole number. The average will then determine success or failure.

### Example

A character wants to pick up an entire large sturdy treasure chest by themselves and take it up a flight of stairs.

The narrator assigns this a Specialized task (CL 3), not only for the weight of the chest but for how cumbersome it is for one person to move. The character gets 2 Wins on their Lift check. They are not able to get the chest up the stairs.

In a parallel dimension, 2 characters decide to pick up the chest. The Narrator assigns this a Common task (CL 1) since people do this every day. The two characters both roll their Lift check. One gets 2 wins and the other gets 1 win. The average is 1.5, which rounds down to 1. They can move the chest up the stairs.
