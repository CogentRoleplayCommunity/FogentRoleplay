# Vocations

Vocations represent your character's job, class, or life path. You should check with your narrator to make sure that your vocation exists in the setting. Some traditional fantasy example vocations are Rogue, Knight, Wizard, Paladin, Cleric, etc... Other example include Vagrant, Chef, or Sailor. Each vocation has one or many governing attributes that logically would govern it.

All skills under a vocation have their levels are capped by their vocation level. For instance, if a character had level a 2 vocation, any skill under it couldn't increase above 2, until it's vocation increased. Each skill under a vocation has one or many governing attributes that logically would govern it. A skill under a vocation can have different governing attributes than the vocation's governing attributes.

There are two kind of skills under a vocation, vocational and combat skills.

## Vocational Skills

Vocational skills logically fall under the vocation and is not covered already by another core skill. Player's can make as many of these skills as they want on the fly with approval from the narrator, though this would mainly be as a reminder to have on the sheet. These skills share the same level as the vocation which they fall under. Skill points are not spent on these skills. You can not assist these skills with the vocation they are fall under.

## Combat Skills

Combat vocational skills include all weapon skills such as "Small Blade", "Medium Sword", "Shortspear", ect... They also include magic skills such as Fallen's "Blazecraft", "Sonocraft", "Polycraft", ect... These skills require skill point to be increased.

### Melee Combat Skill Transfer

For melee weapons, weapon reach, footwork, and the biomechanics of swinging a weapon have some overlap between weapon skills. Starting on with the weapon skill your character currently possesses, each horizontal (right and left on the table) or vertical (up and down on the table) jump is -1 reduction to the skill you've moved to. When moving horizontally within a Size type, you may access the other side of the table as if it were right beside it.

| Class<br />/Size | Hafted         | Blade        | Spear       |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Small            | Small Hafted   | Small Blade |             |
| Medium           | Medium Hafted | Medium Sword |             |
| Large            | Large Hafted  | Large Sword | Short Spear |
| Reach            | Reach Hafted  | Greatsword   | Long Spear  |

### Bow Combat Skill Transfer

For bows and crossbows, having a proper base, judging the distance, leading your targets,  aiming and releasing the projectile smoothly are examples of the overlap. However, bows are significantly harder to use than crossbows. Each right jump (bows to crossbows) or vertical jump (up and down on the table) is -1 reduction to the skill you've moved to. Each left jump (crossbows to bows) is a -2 reduction to the skill you've moved to.

| Class<br />/Size | Bows      | Crossbows      |
| ---------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| Hand             |           | Hand Crossbow  |
| Light            | Light Bow | Light Crossbow |
| Heavy            | Heavy Bow | Heavy Crossbow |

You cannot go below 0 on a combat vocational skill for either melee or ranged.

### Respecing Combat Skills

Since certain weapon sizes provide more combat skill transfer than others, it is intend for the narrator to allow rebalancing skill point investments as to not waste skill levels as long as all previously know skills maintain they're skill level.

For example, a character has just been given a skill point to spend and has a level 3 in Small blade. They wish to invest their skill point into Medium sword to try a new magic sword they found. Since they have a 3 in Small Blade already, by the weapon skill transfer rules they have a level 2 in Medium Sword. If they were to invest their skill point into Medium Sword to bring it to level 3, they are technically wasting skill points as had they from the start only invested the 3 skill points from Small Blade into Medium sword, with the addition of the unspent skill point, they'd have a level 4 in Medium sword, which would also give them a level 3 in Small Blade. Instead of wasting skill points, they can take the 3 skill points from small bladed and the 1 unspent skill point and spend it on bring Medium sword to level 4. Since having a level 4 in Medium Sword gives a level 3 in Small Blade, nothing has changed in Small Blade, so no harm done.

## Example Vocation

Let's assume I have 1 STR, 1 RFX, and 1 INT. I take the Vocation "Chef" and give it the governing attribute RFX and INT. RFX makes sense since Chef's have to use their senses to smell, taste, and quick fine motor control. INT makes sense as they have to have a vast knowledge of recipes and flavor combinations. I increase it to level 2. My "Chef" dice pool is 7d6.

I add the "Wine Knowledge" vocational skill and give it the governing attribute RFX and INT. RFX makes sense as they'd have to use their sense to smell and taste the wine. INT makes sense since they have to have a vast knowledge of wine types and what were good years for wine where the grapes were grown. Wine knowledge is also not covered by any other core skill. I set my "Wine Knowledge" at level 2 since my "Chef" vocation is at level.

I try to make the "Chopping Food" vocational skill and give it the governing attribute RFX. RFX makes sense as they'd have to use fine motor control of their hands to chop quickly. Then remember that the "Sleight of Hand" core skill already exists and that this vocational skill isn't needed.

I add the "Small Blade" combat skill which has the governing attributes STR, RFX, and INT. This makes sense as being stronger, faster, and smarter makes you more deadly with a knife. I spend 1 skill point on it, bringing it to level 1.

I try and add the "Longspear" combat skill. I realized using a longspear is not something that a chef would do, so this will not work.

| Chef {RFX, INT}           | 2 | 7d6 |
| -------------------------- | :-: | :-: |
| Wine Knowledge {RFX, INT} | 2 | 7d6 |
| ~~Chopping Food {RFX}~~   |  |    |
| Small Blade                | 1 | 7d6 |
| ~~Long Spear~~            |  |    |

You may still assist any other roll with your vocation if it makes narrative sense aside from vocational skills.
