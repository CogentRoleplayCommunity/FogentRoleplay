# Vocations

Vocations represent your character's job, class, or life path. You should check with your narrator to make sure that your vocation exists in the setting. Some traditional fantasy example vocations are Rogue, Knight, Wizard, Paladin, Cleric, etc... Other example include Vagrant, Chef, or Sailor. Each vocation has one or many governing attributes that logically would govern it.

All skills under a vocation have their levels are capped by their vocation level. For instance, if a character had level a 2 vocation, any skill under it couldn't increase above 2, until it's vocation increased. Each skill under a vocation has one or many governing attributes that logically would govern it. A skill under a vocation can have different governing attributes than the vocation's governing attributes.

You may still assist any other roll with your vocation if it makes narrative sense aside from vocational skills.

## Vocational Skills

Vocational skills logically fall under the vocation and is not covered already by another core skill. Player's can make as many of these skills as they want on the fly with approval from the narrator, though this would mainly be as a reminder to have on the sheet. These skills share the same level as the vocation which they fall under. Skill points are not spent on these skills. You can not assist these skills with the vocation they are fall under. You may not assist vocational skills with your vocation as they are essentially relying of the same skill point investment.

## Combat Skills

Combat skills include all weapon skills and magic skills. These skills require skill point to be increased.

## Example Vocation

Let's assume I have 1 STR, 1 RFX, and 1 INT. I take the Vocation "Chef" and give it the governing attribute RFX and INT. RFX makes sense since Chef's have to use their senses to smell, taste, and quick fine motor control. INT makes sense as they have to have a vast knowledge of recipes and flavor combinations. I increase it to level 2. My "Chef" vocation dice pool is 7d6.

I add the "Wine Knowledge" vocational skill and give it the governing attribute RFX and INT. RFX makes sense as they'd have to use their sense to smell and taste the wine. INT makes sense since they have to have a vast knowledge of wine types and what were good years for wine where the grapes were grown. Wine knowledge is also not covered by any other core skill. I set my "Wine Knowledge" at level 2 since my "Chef" vocation is at level.

I try to make the "Chopping Food" vocational skill and give it the governing attribute RFX. RFX makes sense as they'd have to use fine motor control of their hands to chop quickly. Then remember that the "Sleight of Hand" core skill already exists and that this vocational skill isn't needed.

I add the "Small Blade" combat skill which has the governing attributes STR, RFX, and INT. This makes sense as being stronger, faster, and smarter makes you more deadly with a knife. It also makes sense that a Chef would know how to use a knife. I spend 1 skill point on it, bringing it to level 1.

I try and add the "Longspear" combat skill. I realized using a longspear is not something that a chef would do, so this will not work.

| Chef {RFX, INT}                | 2 | 7d6 |
| ------------------------------- | :-: | :-: |
| Wine Knowledge {RFX, INT}      | 2 | 7d6 |
| ~~Chopping Food {RFX}~~        |  |    |
| Small Blade {STR, RFX, INT}     | 1 | 7d6 |
| ~~Long Spear {STR, RFX, INT}~~ |  |    |
