# Challenge Levels and Dice Pools

## Dice Pools

Fogent is primarily a D6 dice based game, though D4, D8, D10, D12, and D20 are also used.

All Dice pools start with a base 3 D6 dice. You then add you 1 D6 for each skill point, attribute point, or additional modifier for that dice pool. After the dice pool has been rolled, you sum up the amount of "Wins" from your roll. Any rolled dice that gets a 4 or greater counts as a win.

D6s have a 50% chance of rolling a success, as 4, 5, and 6 on the dice count as wins on the dice. D4s only a 25% chance of success, since only the 4 on the dice counts as a win. In general, the more dice and the more faces the dice has, the better the chances are of getting more wins.

| Dice Type | Probability of Win |
| :-------: | :----------------: |
|    D4    |        25%        |
|    D6    |        50%        |
|    D8    |       62.5%       |
|    D10    |        70%        |
|    D12    |        75%        |
|    D20    |        85%        |


## Challenge Level

Challenge level represent the difficulty of a task set by the narrator proportionate to an **AVERAGE PERSON IN OUR WORLD**. If a character is able to get enough wins to meet or beat the challenge level, they succeeded.

|      Task Difficulty      | Challenge Level |
| :-----------------------: | :-------------: |
|        Common Task        |      CL 1      |
|       Uncommon Task       |      CL 2      |
|     Specialized Task     |      CL 3      |
|      Difficult Task      |      CL 4      |
| Extremely Difficult Task |      CL 5      |
|     Unrealistic Task     |      CL 6      |
| Virtually Impossible Task |      CL 7      |
|    Inconceivable Task    |      CL 8      |

For example, Javk Wick the Rogue wants to move a stone blocking low opening in a wall. The narrator purposes "Since the rock weighs roughly 100 lbs and is pretty slick, but your only trying to shift it over, that will be a Uncommon Task (CL 2) using the Lift Skill".
