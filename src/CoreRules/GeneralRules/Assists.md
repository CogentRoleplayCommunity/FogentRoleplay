# Assists

With Assists, characters can give additional Wins (or if rolled poorly, Losses) with an "assisting" Dice Pool to a "primary" Dice Pool. Characters can Assist themselves or another character. The "assisting" Dice Pool must be rolled first. The "assisting" Dice Pool can be a Skill or Vocation. The "primary" Dice Pool can be a Skill or Combat Roll. It must make logical sense to the Narrator as to why the "assisting" Dice Pool would aid the "main" Dice Pool.

For instance:

- Javk Wick the Rogue has the Vocation Rogue. He is about to make a Stealth check to sneak up on a guard. He asks the Narrator if he could Assist his Stealth check with his Rogue Vocation since being a good Rogue would aid his sneakiness. In this example, Stealth is the "primary" Dice Pool and Rogue is the "assisting" Dice Pool. The Narrator agrees as it makes logical sense.
- Bob the Bard has a Performance Vocational Skill. His friend Thrak the Barbarian is trying to Lift a heavy rock. Bob decides he is going to play a motivational song for Thrak. Bob's player asks the Narrator if he could Assist Thrak's Lift Check with his Performance Skill. In this example, Thrak's Lift is the "primary" Dice Pool and Bob's Performance is the "assisting" Dice Pool. The Narrator agrees as it makes logical sense.

Assists can never use the same Skill for the "assisting" and "primary" Dice Pools. For instance, a character could never assist another character's Lift Check with their own Lift Check, they would instead use the [Multiple Character Skill Check](./Skills.md#multiple-character-skill-check) rules.

**The CL for Assists starts at CL 3 and should never be lower than that.** However, it is up to the narrator to decide if it should be higher than CL 3. In general, most Assists, unless extremely unlikely to aid the current situation, will be made at CL 3.

If the "assisting" Dice Pool achieved more Wins than the Assist CL, additional Wins are added to the result of the "primary" Dice Pool equal to the number of Wins achieved OVER the Assists' CL. If the "assisting" Dice Pool achieved Wins equal to the Assist Cl, no additional Wins are added to the "primary" Dice Pool. If the Assist check achieved fewer Wins than the Assists CL, Wins are subtracted equal to how far BELOW the CL was missed.

Each player can only attempt 1 Assist per Dice Pool. This means that if a player has 2 skills that could logically assist another dice pool they must choose between those 2 skills.

The number of Wins gained or subtracted from an Assist can never be greater than the challenge level of the Assist. For instance, you can only ever receive an additional 3 Wins or losses to a "primary" Dice Pool result if the Assist CL was CL 3.

It's up to the players and the Narrator to negotiate how these assists can be logically applied to different circumstances.

## Example 1:

Thrak the Barbarian is trying to lift a big rock. Bob the Bard decides he is going to play some motivational music on his guitar to Assist Thrak. The narrator agrees and sets a CL 3 Performance Check for the assists. Bob rolls his Performance Vocational skill and gets 4 wins, resulting in +1 wins to Thrak's Lift Check. In a parallel reality, Bob only gets 3 wins, and his song doesn't help Thrak. In another parallel reality, Bob only gets 2 wins on his Performance Check, which produces such horrible music it distracts Thrak resulting in -1 Wins to Thrak's Lift Check.

## Example 2:

Javk Wick the rogue is sneaking up on a guard. Javk's player asks the narrator if he could assist his stealth check to sneak up with his Rogue Vocation. The Narrator agrees and Javk gets +2 Wins from his Assist, making the following stealth check far easier.

## Example 3:

Javk Wick the rogue is in combat. Javk's player asks the narrator if he could assist his dagger combat roll with his Rogue Vocation. The Narrator agrees and Javk gets +1 Wins from his Assist.
