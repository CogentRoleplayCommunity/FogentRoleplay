# Assists

Core Skills, Vocational Skills, Combat Skills and Vocations can all be used to perform assist rolls. An assist roll is a roll players can make to (potentially) gain additional dice to aid their primary action/objective. Assist rolls are made before the action which the player wishes to receive the assist. Assists may be applied to any logically applicable roll – and the player must first ask the Narrator if the assist roll is appropriate.

If the player is in a position where a skill they possess would logically assist or grant an advantage to another skill or combat roll the Narrator can assign a Challenge Level ( **CL** ) based on the difficulty of the assist.

**The CL for assists starts at three and should never be lower than that.** However, it is up to the narrator to decide if it should be higher than three. In general, most assist roles, unless extremely unlikely to aid the current situation, will be made at **CL** three.

If the assist check was successful, additional wins are added to the result of the skill or combat roll the player has assisted – equivalent to the number of wins achieved OVER the Assist **CL** in the assist check. If the assist check was unsuccessful, penalty wins are applied equal to how much the assist check missed the CL.

For Example:

**3 wins** against an assist **CL** of **3** does nothing to assist the following action, but **4 wins** will grant **+1 win** to the result of the assisted action's roll.

On the other hand, if a player achieves only **1 win** in an assist roll of  **CL 3** , the player will then face a **penalty of -2**, to be deducted from the result of the assisted action's roll. This means that any assist can backfire, and as such carries an element or risk.

Each player can only attempt 1 assist each round. This means that if a player has 2 skills that could logically assist another skill check or combat roll they must choose between those 2 skills.

The number of wins gained or losses subtracted from an assist can never be greater than the challenge level of the assist. For instance, you can only ever receive an additional 3 wins or losses to a skill or attack that you're trying to assist if the assist check had was  **CL3** . Likewise, an assist check with a **CL4**  will add a cap at max 4 wins or losses depending on the outcome of the assist check.

It's up to the players and Narrator to negotiate how these assists can be logically applied to different circumstances.

Having said this, if you are acting as the Narrator you will find that players will try for some very thin connections between a given skill they possess and the situation they are in to attempt a skill check or a possible assist. The players must feel free to express their logic to the Narrator and the Narrator should listen to all requests fairly – cooperative negotiation is something that the players and narrator should engage in as it helps the narrative reach new creative levels – but in the end it will be the narrator's call and the players must accept what the Narrator decides.
