# Assists

All Skills and Vocations can all be used to perform Assists. With Assists, players can give additional wins (or if rolled poorly, losses) to themselves or others dice pools. Assists can never use the same skill as the skill of the Dice Pool being assisted. Assists may be applied to any logically applicable Dice Pool that would benefit, but the player must first ask the Narrator if it is appropriate and what the Challenge Level of the Assist will be.

**The CL for assists starts at three and should never be lower than that.** However, it is up to the narrator to decide if it should be higher than three. In general, most assist roles, unless extremely unlikely to aid the current situation, will be made at **CL** three.

If the assist check was successful, additional wins are added to the result of the assisted dice pool equal to the number of wins achieved OVER the Assist **CL**. If the assist check was unsuccessful, wins are subtracted equal to how far BELOW the CL was missed.

Each player can only attempt 1 assist per Dice Pool. This means that if a player has 2 skills that could logically assist another dice pool they must choose between those 2 skills.

The number of wins gained or losses subtracted from an assist can never be greater than the challenge level of the assist. For instance, you can only ever receive an additional 3 wins or losses to a dice pool that you're trying to assist if the assist check was **CL 3** .

It's up to the players and Narrator to negotiate how these assists can be logically applied to different circumstances.

## Example 1:

Thrak the barbarian is trying to lift a big rock. Bob the bard decides he is going to play some motivational music on his guitar to Assist Thrak. The narrator agrees and sets a CL 3 Performance Check for the assists. Bob rolls his Performance Vocational skill and gets 4 wins, resulting in +1 wins to Thrak's Lift Check. In an parallel reality, Bob only gets 3 wins, and his song doesn't really help Thrak. In another parallel reality Bob only gets 2 wins on his Performance Check, which produces such horrible music it distracts Thrak resulting in -1 wins to Thrak's Lift Check.

## Example 2:

Javk Wick the rogue is sneaking up on a guard. Javk's player asks the narrator if he could assist his stealth check to sneak up with his Rogue Vocation. The Narrator agrees and Javk get +2 wins from his Assists, making the following stealth check far more easy.

## Example 3:

Javk Wick the rogue is in combat. Javk's player asks the narrator if he could assist his dagger combat roll with his Rogue Vocation. The Narrator agrees and Javk get +1 wins from his Assist.
