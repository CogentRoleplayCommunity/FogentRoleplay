# Advantage and Disadvantage

Advantage and Disadvantage represent circumstances that favor or disfavor a character, resulting in better or worse odds of achieving Wins.

Advantages and Disadvantages only apply to a single dice pool, not additional dice pools such as from Assists. For example, if a character has Advantage on a stealth check and decides to assist with their "Rogue" vocation, then the Advantage only applies to the Stealth dice pool and not to the "Rogue" dice pool. However, the character could preemptively use a destiny point to gain Advantage on the "Rogue" assist dice pool.

## Advantage

Advantage is gained when circumstance favors a character. For any dice rolled, 3's count as wins for that roll.

## Disadvantage

Disadvantage is gained when circumstance disfavors a character. For any dice rolled, 4's count as failures for that roll.

## Super Advantage

Gained under very specific conditions when the stars have aligned for your character. For any dice rolled, 3s and 2s count as wins for that roll.

## Super Disadvantage

Gained under very specific conditions when your character has drawn the short straw. For any dice rolled, 4's and 5's count as failures for that roll.

## Super Advantage/Disadvantage overriding Advantage/Disadvantage

Super Advantage/Disadvantage completely overrides Advantage and Disadvantage on any roll.

## Advantages and Disadvantages cancelling out

If on a roll a character had both Advantage and Disadvantage, the two effects cancel out leaving you with only a normal roll. If a character had two sources giving you Advantage, then you would still only have Advantage. However, if the character had two sources of Advantage and one source of Disadvantage, then one advantage would cancel out with the only disadvantage, leaving you with Advantage.

In the extreme case that a character has Super Advantage and Super Disadvantage, they cancel out the same way Advantage and Disadvantage do.
