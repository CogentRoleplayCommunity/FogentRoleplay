# Advantage and Disadvantage

Advantage/disadvantage/super advantage/super disadvantage only applies to a single dice pool, not additional dice pools such as from assists. For example, if I have advantage on a stealth check and decide to assist with my "Rogue" vocation, than the advantage only applies on the stealth dice pool and not on the "Rogue" dice pool. However, I could preemptively use a destiny point to gain advantage on the "Rogue" assist dice pool.

## Advantage

Advantage is gained when you character gains the upper hand in a fight or circumstance favors them. For any dice rolled, 3's count as a success for that roll.

 In combat this could be taking the highground, flanking an opponent, or attacking a downed opponent in melee. This can also be gained by spending a Destiny point preemptively on a roll.

## Disadvantage

Disadvantage is gained when your character loses the upper hand in a fight or circumstance disfavors them. For any dice rolled, 4's count as a failure for that roll.

In combat this could be losing your balance from a stagger, having to fight in melee while on the ground, or attacking a downed opponent in from range.

## Super Advantage

Gained under very specific conditions when the stars have aligned for your character. For any dice rolled, 3s and 2s count as a success for that roll.

Super advantage can only gain when you already have advantage that was the result of another player character's action. You must then spend a destiny point preemptively, resulting in super advantage. This is equivalent to an awesome teamwork moment. Whether it's a massive combo attack or a daring political power play, it should be treated as a cool moment.

Super advantage can also be gained when finishing off an incapacitated opponent.

## Super Disadvantage

Gained under very specific conditions when your character has drawn the short straw. For any dice rolled, 4's and 5's count as a failure for that roll.

Super disadvantage can only be gained when your are attempting something that has virtually no chance of succeeding. For instance, in combat trying to hit someone well beyond your weapons effective range (see Effective Range Exceeded in Combat Modifiers).

## Advantage and Disadvantage cancelling out

If on a roll you had disadvantage, but were able to get advantage from some other benefit, than the two effects cancel out leaving you with only a normal roll. If you had two sources giving you advantage, than you would still only have advantage. However, if you had two sources of advantage and one source of disadvantage, than one advantage would cancel out with the only disadvantage, leaving you with advantage.

## Applying Disadvantage/Advantage to an already rolled Dice Pool

If your character gains a disadvantage (often the result of a stagger or being knocked prone) or advantage after you've already rolled a dice pool that round (combat roll dice pool, dodge dice pool, ect...), you will retroactively apply said disadvantage/advantage to your current dice pool. This could turn some dice that were wins into fails and vice versa.
