# Advantage and Disadvantage

Advantage/disadvantage only applies to a single dice pool, not additional dice pools such as from assists. For example, if a character has advantage on a stealth check and decide to assist thier "Rogue" vocation, than the advantage only applies on the Stealth dice pool and not on the "Rogue" dice pool. However, the character could preemptively use a destiny point to gain advantage on the "Rogue" assist dice pool.

## Advantage

Advantage is gained when you circumstance favors a character. For any dice rolled, 3's count as a success for that roll.

## Disadvantage

Disadvantage is gained when circumstance disfavors a character. For any dice rolled, 4's count as a failure for that roll.

## Super Advantage

Gained under very specific conditions when the stars have aligned for your character. For any dice rolled, 3s and 2s count as a success for that roll.

## Super Disadvantage

Gained under very specific conditions when your character has drawn the short straw. For any dice rolled, 4's and 5's count as a failure for that roll.

## Advantage and Disadvantage cancelling out

If on a roll you had disadvantage, but were able to get advantage from some other benefit, than the two effects cancel out leaving you with only a normal roll. If you had two sources giving you advantage, than you would still only have advantage. However, if you had two sources of advantage and one source of disadvantage, than one advantage would cancel out with the only disadvantage, leaving you with advantage.

## Applying Disadvantage/Advantage to an already rolled Dice Pool

If your character gains a disadvantage (often the result of a stagger or being knocked prone) or advantage after you've already rolled a dice pool that round (combat roll dice pool, dodge dice pool, ect...), you will retroactively apply said disadvantage/advantage to your current dice pool. This could turn some dice that were wins into fails and vice versa.
