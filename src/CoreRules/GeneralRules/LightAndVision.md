# Light and Vision

## Light

In the context of role-playing games, the ability of a character to see is crucial for various tasks. These tasks include identifying threats, locating hidden items, attacking enemies, and directing spells, among others. The character's visibility can be significantly impaired by darkness or any other factors that obscure vision.

There are different levels of obscurity that a given area can have, ranging from light to heavy. An area is considered lightly obscured if it has dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage. In such areas, creatures face a disadvantage on (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

On the other hand, an area is heavily obscured when it has darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage. In these areas, vision is entirely blocked. Any creature trying to see something in a heavily obscured area is effectively blinded.

The illumination of an environment is categorized into three types: bright light, dim light, and darkness.

### Bright Light

Most creatures, including humans, can see normally in bright light. This light can come from various sources such as torches, lanterns, fires, or even gloomy days, and it illuminates within a specific radius.

### Dim Light

Also referred to as shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. This area is typically a boundary between a source of bright light, like a torch, and the surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn, or even a particularly brilliant full moon, also counts as dim light.

Character's attempting to perform any task in Dim Light that relies on sight have Disadvantage. To counteract this, Character's can assist with a Perception Assist.

### Darkness

Darkness, on the other hand, creates a heavily obscured area. Characters encounter darkness outdoors at night (excluding moonlight nights), inside an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.

Creatures attempting to perform any task reliant on sight in Darkness have Super DisadvantageF. To counteract this, Character's can assist with a Perception Assist.

## Vision

### Blindsight

Blindsight allows a creature to perceive its environment without the need for sight, within a certain range. It's typically found in creatures that lack eyes, such as oozes, or in those that have heightened senses or use echolocation, like bats and true dragons. These creatures are able to sense their surroundings regardless of visual obstructions or conditions.

### Darkvision

A special ability that many creatures in fantasy realms, particularly those that live underground, possess. This ability allows a creature to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and see in darkness as if it were dim light up to a certain distance. However, the trade-off is that they can't distinguish colors in the dark, only different shades of gray.

### Truesight

A being possessing truesight can, within a designated range, perceive both in regular and magical darkness, observe invisible entities and objects, effortlessly discern visual illusions, succeed on skill checks against them, and discern the true form of a shapechanger or a creature altered by magic. Additionally, this creature has the ability to see into the Ethereal Plane.
