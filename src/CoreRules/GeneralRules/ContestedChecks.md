## Contested Checks

Contested check occur when two characters are in conflict. The most obvious example of this is fighting, though other examples such as drinking contests, arm wrestling, or stealth vs perception.

### Tied Contested Checks

Often time, Contested Checks result in ties. If ties occur when within combat, ties result in neither side making progress and the contested check is a stalemate. This is because dice rolls in combat stand for the entire round and should not be rerolled. Otherwise, ties in any other contested check outside of combat can just be rerolled to establish a clear winner.

Combat example 1:

Two characters are in combat and roll their dice pools versus one another. Each of them gets 2 wins on thier combat roll. They clash but aren't able to injury eachother.

Combat example 2:

A rogue and a knight are fight each other in combat. The rogue wants to use the dim light of the room to get around the night and sneak attack him. The rogue rolls stealth and the knight rolls perception. They both get 2 wins. The contested check is a stalemate and the rogue is not able to enter into stealth. Looks like he'll have to fight him without the aid of the shadows this round.

Combat example 3:

A rogue and a knight are fight each other in combat. The rogue has already used the dim light of the room to successfully hide behind some crates last round. The knight declares he is trying to find the rogue on his turn and attack him. The rogue rolls stealth and the knight rolls perception. They both get 2 wins. The contest check is a stalemate and the rogue remains hidden. The rogue uses his stealth to sneak attack the knight.

Non-combat example 4:

Outside of combat, a rogue is trying to sneak up on a knight. The rogue rolls stealth and the knight rolls perception. They both get 2 wins. They reroll to determine a clear winner.
