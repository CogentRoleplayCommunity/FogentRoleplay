# Base Dice Tiers

Base dice are always represented by 3 dice, however depending on a Base Dice Tier, which type of 3 dice can change for better or worse. They can either effect the base dice of a skill dice poop or a weapon combat roll dice pool.

A Base Dice Tier on a weapon only effects that specific weapon an not others. For instance, a Mundane dagger has base dice of 3d6 for a combat roll. With a Mythic dagger, the base dice would be 2d20 and 1d12.

A Base Dice Tier effecting a skill changes applies anywhere that skill is used. For instance, if a Mundane Fire Magic Spellcasting Focus is used, all uses of the Fire Magic Skill have 3d6. With a Excellent Fire Magic Spellcasting Focus, all uses of the Fire magic Skill have 3d8 instead.

Base Dice Tiers also apply to tools used in skill rolls (high-quality climbing equipment for use with Athletics), and is meant to apply both in and out of combat.
