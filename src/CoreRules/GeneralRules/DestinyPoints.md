# Destiny Points

A Destiny Point represents a players ability to tip the scales of fate in favor of their character. Characters can hold up to a maximum of 3 destiny points.

## Preemptive Destiny Point

A player can spend one destiny point before rolling a dice pool to gain advantage on the resulting roll.

## Post Roll Destiny Points

A player can spend one or many Destiny Points after any Dice Pool roll to add additional Win for each point spent to the result. The Wins achieved the DIce Pool roll can never exceed the number of dice rolled. For instance, if a Dice Pool of 5d6 was rolled with 5 Wins achieved, spending Post Roll Destiny Points is unallowed.

## Awarding Destiny Points

Destiny points are awarded when players perform actions that the narrator wants to encourage.

- Players showing up to the game on time
- Exceptional roleplay
- Accomplishing a major milestone (defeating a boss or completing a quest)
- Crazy high dice rolls
- Doing something in line with their character's personality even if at the detriment to wealth or progress

## Player vs Player Destiny points (Optional)

If two players are competing against one another in a dice roll, then destiny points can only be used preemptively. This is to ensure players don't waste all their destiny points fighting each other.
