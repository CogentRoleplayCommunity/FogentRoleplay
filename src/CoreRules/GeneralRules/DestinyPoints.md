# Destiny Points

A Destiny Point represents a player's ability to tip the scales of fate in favor of their character. Characters can hold up to a maximum of 3 destiny points.

## Preemptive Destiny Point

A player can spend one destiny point before rolling a dice pool to gain Advantage on the resulting roll.

## Post Roll Destiny Points

After a Dice Pool is rolled, a player can spend one or many Destiny Points to add additional Wins for each point spent to the result. The Wins achieved in the Dice Pool roll can never exceed the number of dice rolled. For instance, if a Dice Pool of 5d6 was rolled with 5 Wins achieved, spending Post Roll Destiny Points can't be done.

## Awarding Destiny Points

Destiny points are awarded when players perform actions that the narrator wants to encourage.

- Players showing up to the game on time
- Exceptional roleplay
- Accomplishing a major milestone (defeating a boss or completing a quest)
- Crazy high dice rolls
- Doing something in line with their character's personality even if at the detriment of wealth or progress

## Destiny Point Effects

These are two effect that can be placed on any character to increase their resistance to destiny points being used against them. These are generally given out for two purposes:

- Given to player characters to ensure players don't waste all their destiny points competing against each other on silly rolls.
- Given to villains/bosses to dramatically increase how dangerous they are. Nothing scares players quite like telling them Destiny Points don't work versus a powerful foe...

In general, Player Characters are given "Destiny Resistance" by default, though this is up to the narrator.
