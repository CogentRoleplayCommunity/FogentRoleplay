# Destiny Points

A Destiny Point represents a players ability to tip the scales of fate in favor of their character. Characters can hold up to a maximum of 3 destiny points.

## Preemptive Destiny Point

A player can spend one destiny point before rolling a dice pool to gain advantage on the resulting roll.

## Post Roll Destiny Points

A character may spend a Destiny Point after any dice pool roll to add a single win in addition to what they achieved. They may do this multiple times on any roll or separate rolls, for as many Destiny Points they have.

## Awarding Destiny Points

Destiny points are awarded when players perform actions that the narrator wants to encourage.

- Players showing up to the game on time
- Exceptional roleplay
- Accomplishing a major milestone (defeating a boss or completing a quest)
- Crazy high dice rolls
- Doing something in line with their character's personality even if at the detriment to wealth or progress

## Player vs Player Destiny points (Optional)

If two players are competing against one another in a dice roll, then destiny points can only be used preemptively. This is to ensure players don't waste all their destiny points fighting each other.
