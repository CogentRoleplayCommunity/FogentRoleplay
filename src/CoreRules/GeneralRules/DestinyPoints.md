# Destiny Points

A Destiny Point represents a player's ability to tip the scales of fate in favor of their character.

Destiny Point Effects are for the following two kinds of characters:

- Player Characters are given "Destiny Chosen" and "Destiny Resistance" by default. "Destiny Chosen" allows players to influence the story at key moments they decide. "Destiny Resistance" is mainly to prevent Player Characters from wasting all there Destiny Points against one another on silly rolls.
- Villain/Boss NPC can be given different combinations of these effects to dramatically increase how dangerous they are. Nothing scares players quite like telling them Destiny Points don't work versus a powerful foe...

Destiny points are awarded when players perform actions that the narrator wants to encourage.

- Players showing up to the game on time
- Exceptional roleplay
- Accomplishing a major milestone (defeating a boss or completing a quest)
- Crazy high dice rolls
- Doing something in line with their character's personality even if at the detriment of wealth or progress

Spending a "Preemptive Destiny Point" before rolling a dice pool gives Advantage on the resulting roll.
