## Dice Pools

Fogent is primarily a D6 dice based game, though D4, D8, D10, D12, and D20 are also used.

All Dice pools start with a base 3 D6 dice. You then add you a D6 for each skill point, attribute point, or additional modifier for that dice pool. After the dice pool has been rolled, you sum up the amount of "Wins" from your roll. Any rolled dice that gets a 4 or greater counts as a win.

D6s have a 50% chance of rolling a success, as 4, 5, and 6 on the dice count as wins on the dice. D4s only a 25% chance of success, since only the 4 on the dice counts as a win. In general, the more dice and the more faces the dice has, the better the chances are of getting more wins.
