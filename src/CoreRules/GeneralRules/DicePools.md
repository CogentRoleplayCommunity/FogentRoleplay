# Dice Pools

D6 dice are the most common dice used, though D4, D8, D10, D12, and D20 are also used.

All Dice pools start with 3 D6 dice, known as base dice. You then add a D6 for each skill point, attribute point, or additional modifier that governs the dice pool. After the dice pool has been rolled, you sum up the amount of "Wins" from the roll. Any rolled dice that gets a 4 or greater counts as a win.

D6 dice have a 50% chance of rolling a win, as 4, 5, and 6 on the dice are wins. D4s only a 25% chance of a win, since only the 4 on the dice counts as a win. In general, the more dice and the more faces the dice has, the better the chances are of getting more wins.

| Dice Type | Probability of Win |
| :-------: | :----------------: |
|    D4    |        25%        |
|    D6    |        50%        |
|    D8    |       62.5%       |
|    D10    |        70%        |
|    D12    |        75%        |
|    D20    |        85%        |

## Removing Dice from a Dice Pool

Whenever you are removing dice from a dice pool (often done after taking an injury), always remove the lowest sided dice first. For instance, d4 dice are always removed first, then d6, and so on.
