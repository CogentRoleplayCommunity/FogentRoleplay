# Dice Pools

D6 dice (otherwise known as six-sided dice) are the most common dice used, though D4, D8, D10, D12, and D20 are also used.

All Dice pools start with your "Base Dice", which by default are 3d6. You then add a D6 for each skill point, attribute point, or additional modifier that governs the dice pool. After the dice pool has been rolled, you sum up the amount of "Wins" from the roll. Any rolled dice that gets a 4 or greater counts as a win.

D6 dice have a 50% chance of rolling a win, as 4, 5, and 6 on the dice are wins. D4s only have a 25% chance of a win, since only the 4 on the dice counts as a win. In general, the more dice and the more faces the dice have, the better the chances are of getting more wins.

| Dice Type | Probability of Win |
| :-------: | :----------------: |
|    D4    |        25%        |
|    D6    |        50%        |
|    D8    |       62.5%       |
|    D10    |        70%        |
|    D12    |        75%        |
|    D20    |        85%        |

## Removing Dice from a Dice Pool

Whenever you are removing dice from a dice pool (often done after taking an injury), always remove the lowest-sided dice first. For instance, d4 dice are always removed first, then d6, and so on.

# Base Dice Tiers

Base dice are always represented by 3 dice, however depending on a Base Dice Tier, which type of 3 dice can change for better or worse. For instance, a mundane dagger has base dice of 3d6 for a combat roll. With a Mythic dagger, the base dice would be 2d20 and 1d12.

Base Dice Tiers also applies to Magic Conduits, tools used in skill rolls (high-quality climbing equipment for use with Athletics), and is meant to apply both in and out of combat.
