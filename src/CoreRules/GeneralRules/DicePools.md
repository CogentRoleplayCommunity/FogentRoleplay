# Dice Pools

Fallen is a D6 dice based game (though other dice are also used).

All Dice pools start with a base 3 D6 dice. You then add you 1 D6 for each skill point, attribute point, or additional modifier for that dice pool. After the dice pool has been rolled, you sum up the amount of "Wins" from your roll. Any 4, 5, 6, or greater number from a rolled dice counts as a win.
