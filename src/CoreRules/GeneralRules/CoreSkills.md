# Core Skills

Core Skills are skills that cover the majority of what most creatures can perform outside of combat skills. Core Skills are each governed by an attribute that it would logically fall under.

## Strength Core Skills

### Athletics

Represented by sprinters, high jumpers, swimmers and climbers. Covers physical activity related to raw running speed, jump height and general movement. It covers throwing light objects and catching them. Examples include chasing someone, jumping over a pit, swimming in turbulent water, throwing a ball, climbing a rock face, descending a rope or crawling if prone.

### Endurance

Represented by ultra-marathon runners. Represents your body's ability to process toxins and resist disease. Examples include resisting food poisoning, enduring hot/cold weather, and pushing on past exhaustion are all the domains of endurance.

### Lift

Represented by strong men or powerlifters. Covers physical activity related to raw strength, most used in moving or holding heavy objects. Examples include shouldering a door open, carrying or throwing heavy weights, or crushing something in your hands.

## Reflex Core Skills

### Acrobatics

Represented by circus performers, parkourists or cat burglars. Covers movements requiring agility, highly dexterous control over ones body, and finesse as well as balance. Parkour, backflips, squeezing through tight gaps and walking tightropes are all the domain of Acrobatics. Acrobatics is also the skill used for riding animals, dodging, and avoiding traps/pitfalls.

### Perception

Perception is the art of detecting things through the 5 senses, including sight, sound, scent, touch, and taste. It is used as the defense against stealth; it will be common for the Narrator to require players to make environmental 'Perception Checks' to gauge how much the characters notice regarding current happenings or places.

### Stealth

Represented by ninjas, assassins, and pickpockets. Sneaking, hiding from others, picking pockets, and moving with no noise form the basis of the Stealth skill. Stealth can be used for setting up ambushes and laying traps. Stealth is often countered by Perception, and the two forces of hide and seek clash constantly.

## Intelligence Core Skills

### Communication

Represented by politicians or con men. It is a measure of your verbal and non-verbal social skills. While anyone can try persuading, deceiving, bartering, or seducing, it is how you communicate that will ultimately entail success or failure. It's not what you say, but how you say it. It also is used to tell if someone is lying or deceiving you.

### General Knowledge

Represented by historians, bookworms, detectives and street smarts. General Knowledge is the art of listening to rumors, recalling information, performing deductive analysis, and applying it where it is needed most. On the street smarts side, it keeps you from going too close to dangerous gang territory, it lets you know who and where to avoid.

A character with a specific knowledge skill (such as a vocational skill) strongly related to the task being attempted would always have an easier skill check than a character using general knowledge. For instance, a baker and a detective are trying to determine which pastry shop made the poisoned box of pastries at a crime scene. The baker using his "Baker Knowledge" skill might only be required to achieve a Common skill check (CL 1) were as the detective using his General Knowledge skill might be required to make a Uncommon skill check (CL 2).

### Will

Measures a character's mental and spiritual control/strength, exerted to do something or restrain impulses. This could be to do something gross but necessary, resist being verbally, mentally, or spiritually manipulated/attacked, resist being seduced or holding your cool in a scary situation. In a setting with supernatural elements, Will also affects your ability to force yourself to see what is actually beyond the mundane where the mind is generally most comfortable.
