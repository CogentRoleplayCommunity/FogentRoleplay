# Disabling Characteristics

Disabling characteristics represent flaws your character has. This is an essential part of every great character as everyone needs a shortcoming to overcome or a temptation to fall into. It should be noted that disabling characteristics can be remedied through narrative with the narrator's approval. If Disabling Characteristics are gained mid-campaign, it should make intuitive sense for that character. Maybe they picked up an addiction, got their heart broken, have a new fear of a monster they've recently faced or are suffering the long-lasting impact of a serious injury they took. Regardless this should be a negotiation between the player and narrator.

Players that take a Disabling Characteristic that results in a -1 in an Attribute (STR, RFX, or INT would be Feeble, Heavy, Dim-witted, etc...) gain an additional 2 skill points at character creation.
