## Tiers of Play

Tiers of play (which are commonly called levels in TTRPG) narratively describe the stakes of the campaign. Your narrator should let you know your tier of play and you should factor this into your character as it would be silly to have your character's backstory to paint them as a badass only to have them start at initiate tier. Also realize that your character will grow throughout the course of their story and your narrator will be rewarding you will skill points as you play. Once you've gained 6 skill points, you move up to the next tier of play.
