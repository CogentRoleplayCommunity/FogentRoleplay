# Tier of Play

Tier of play narratively describes the stakes of the campaign as well as how powerful/competent player characters are. This balances the players against each other and the challenges the Narrator has envisioned.

Your narrator should let you know your tier of play and you should factor this into your character as it would be silly to have your character's backstory to paint them as a badass only to have them start at Apprentice Tier. Also, realize that your character will grow throughout their story and your narrator will be rewarding you with ways to improve your character as you play.

## Tier of Play Breakdown

### Skill/Vocation Level Cap

This is the maximum you can take any skill or vocation level to in the tier of play.

### Vocation Point

Points that can only be spent to unlock or upgrade Vocations.

### Attribute Points

The number of points you can spend to increase a character's Attributes.

### Skill Points

The number of points you get to spend on Core Skills, Vocations, and Combat Skills.

At character creation, for each Core Skill made Incompetent (level -1), an additional skill point is gained.

### Disabling Characteristics

Disabling characteristics represent flaws your character has. This is an essential part of every great character as everyone needs a shortcoming to overcome or a temptation to fall into. It should be noted that disabling characteristics can be remedied through narrative with the narrator's approval. If Disabling Characteristics are gained mid-campaign, it should make intuitive sense for that character. Maybe they picked up an addiction, got their heart broken, have a new fear of a monster they've recently faced or are suffering the long-lasting impact of a serious injury they took. Regardless this should be a negotiation between the player and narrator.

Players that take a Disabling Characteristic that results in a -1 in STR, RFX, or INT (Feeble, Heavy, Dim-witted, etc...) gain an additional 2 skill points at character creation.
