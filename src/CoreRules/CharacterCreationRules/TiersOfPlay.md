# Tier Of Play

Tier Of Play narratively describes the stakes of the campaign as well as how powerful/competent player characters are. This balances the players against each other and the challenges the Narrator has envisioned.

The Narrator should let the players know the Tier Of Play and players should factor this into their characters. It would be silly to have a character's backstory paint them as a badass only to have them start at Apprentice Tier. Also, realize that your character will grow throughout their story and the Narrator will be rewarding players with ways to improve your character as they play.

Whenever building a character starting at a higher level than 1, you must build that character as if they were starting from level one.

## Tier of Play Breakdown

### Skill/Vocation Level Cap

This is the maximum you can take any skill or vocation level to in the Tier Of Play.

### Vocation Point

Points that can only be spent to unlock or upgrade Vocations.

### Attribute Points

The number of points you can spend to increase a character's Attributes.

### Skill Points

The number of points you get to spend on Core Skills, Vocations, and Combat Skills.

### Disabling Characteristics

See [Disabling Characteristics](./DisablingCharacteristics.md).

At character creation, for each Disabling Characteristic that makes a Core Skill Incompetent (level -1), an additional skill point is gained.

At character creation, for each Disabling Characteristic that makes an Attribute level -1, an additional 2 skill points are gained.
