##### Dodge

When an attack is made against a character who is not returning fire or attacking back, the defender can make an Acrobatics Roll vs the attacker's Combat Roll. Any levels over the defender's Dodge wins count as victories for the attacker. The Dodge Roll counts for the entire round. A Combat Roll and Dodge Roll can both be made in a round. If the character takes the Defensive combat modifier, then it is also applied.

#### Perception

Perception is the art of detecting things through the 5 senses, including sight, sound, scent, touch, and taste. It is used as the defense against stealth; it will be common for the Narrator to require players make environmental 'Perception Checks' to gauge how much the characters notice regarding current happenings or places. It is important to note many types of skills may commonly be used to assist with perception, especially vocational ones.

#### Sleight of Hand

Represented by pickpockets or magicians. Activities that require highly dexterous control of the hands are covered by Sleight of Hand. While more obvious tasks such as picking pockets come to mind, the skill also covers things such as playing a guitar, weaving a small basket or threading a needle. Also very applicable as an assist roll for finesse like weapons such as daggers, short swords, or rapiers.

#### Stealth

Represented by ninjas or assassins. Sneaking, hiding from others and moving with no noise forms the basis of the Stealth skill. Stealth can be used for setting up ambushes and laying traps. Stealth is often countered by Perception, and the two forces of hide and seek clash constantly.

### Intelligence Core Skills

#### Communication

Represented by politicians or con men. It is a measure of your verbal and non-verbal social skills. While anyone can try persuading, deceiving, bartering, or seducing, it is the manner in which you communicate that will ultimately entail success or failure. It's not what you say, but how you say it. It also is used to tell if someone is lying or deceiving you.

#### General Knowledge

Represented by a historian, bookworm, or detective. General Knowledge is the art of listening to rumors, recalling information, performing deductive analysis, and applying it where it is needed most. It also It aids in many tasks while being very specifically only usable on non-specialized tasks.

#### Survival

It covers scavenging for food, basic first aid as well as finding safe places to rest, lighting fires, and tracking. In the city, survival keeps you from going too close to dangerous gang territory, it lets you know who to avoid, and where to avoid. It might also give you a gut feeling when a criminal deal turns out to be a ambush. In the wilderness, it tells you which berries will make you sick, which meat is spoiled and more.

#### Will

Measures a character's mental and spiritual control/strength, exerted to do something or restrain impulses. This could be to do something gross but necessary, resist being verbally, mentally, or spiritually manipulated/attacked, resist being seduced and hold your cool in a scary situation. In setting with super natural, will also effects your ability to force oneself to see what is actually beyond the mere mundane where the mind is generally most comfortable.

## Skill Specialty

Once a dice pool for a given skill check is equal to or greater than 8 you are considered a specialist in that skill. If you are a specialist for a skill, when asked to make a check for that skill with a Challenge Level of 3 or less, you automatically pass if all of the following are true.

- You are not under duress (No time pressure, no outside influences or aggression such as combat.)
- The check is not a contested check.
- The check is not a reflexive action.

## Weapon Skill Transfer

### Melee Combat Skill Transfer

For melee weapons, weapon reach, footwork, and the biomechanics of swinging a weapon have some overlap between weapon skills. Starting on with the weapon skill your character currently possesses, each horizontal (right and left on the table) or vertical (up and down on the table) jump is -1 reduction to the skill you've moved to. When moving horizontally within a Size type, you may access the other side of the table as if it were right beside it.

| Class<br />/Size | Hafted         | Blade        | Spear       |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Small            | Small Hafted   | Small Blade |             |
| Medium           | Medium Hafted | Medium Sword |             |
| Large            | Large Hafted  | Large Sword | Short Spear |
| Reach            | Reach Hafted  | Greatsword   | Long Spear  |

### Bow Combat Skill Transfer

For bows and crossbows, having a proper base, judging the distance, leading your targets,  aiming and releasing the projectile smoothly are examples of the overlap. However, bows are significantly harder to use than crossbows. Each right jump (bows to crossbows) or vertical jump (up and down on the table) is -1 reduction to the skill you've moved to. Each left jump (crossbows to bows) is a -2 reduction to the skill you've moved to.

| Class<br />/Size | Bows      | Crossbows      |
| ---------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| Hand             |           | Hand Crossbow  |
| Light            | Light Bow | Light Crossbow |
| Heavy            | Heavy Bow | Heavy Crossbow |

You cannot go below 0 on a combat vocational skill for either melee or ranged.

### Respecing Combat Skills

Since certain weapon sizes provide more combat skill transfer than others, it is intend for the narrator to allow rebalancing skill point investments as to not waster skill levels as long as all previously know skills maintain they're skill level.

For example, a character has just been given a skill point to spend and has a level 3 in Small blade. They wish to invest their skill point into Medium sword to try a new magic sword they found. Since they have a 3 in Small Blade already, by the weapon skill transfer rules they have a level 2 in Medium Sword. If they were to invest their skill point into Medium Sword to bring it to level 3, they are technically wasting skill points as had they from the start only invested the 3 points from Small Blade into Medium sword, with the addition of the unspent skill point, they'd have a level 4 in Medium sword, which would also give them a level 3 in Small Blade. Instead of wasting skill points, they can take the 3 skill points from small bladed and the 1 unspent skill point and spend it on bring Medium sword to level 4. Since having a level 4 in small bladed gives a level 3 in Small Bladed, nothing has changed in Small Blade, so no harm done.

## Multiple Character skill check

Multiple characters may contribute to the same skill check. The narrator should than evaluate the challenge level in the context of if multiple characters where performing it. All characters make their skill check, from which the average is taken. The average will then determine success or failure.

### Example

A character wants to pick up an entire sturdy couch by themselves, and take it up a flight of stairs.

The narrator assigns this a Specialized task (CL 3), not only for the weigh of the couch, but for how cumbersome it is for one person. The character get 2 win on their Lift check. They are not able to get the couch up the stairs.

In a parallel dimension, 2 characters decide to pick up the couch. The narrator assigns this a Common task (CL 1) since people do this every day. The two characters both roll their Lift check. One gets 2 wins and the other gets 1 win. The average is 1.5, which is rounded down to 1. They are able to move the couch up the stairs.
