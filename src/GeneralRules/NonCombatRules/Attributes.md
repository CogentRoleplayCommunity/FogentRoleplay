## Common Questions

### Why is there no Charisma stat

Intelligence governs the "Communications" skill which is essentially your classical charisma stat. The reality is, being smarter abosolutely makes you a better communicator. Verbal IQ is one of the componnets of an IQ test for a reason. Also, emotional intelligence doesn't exist.
