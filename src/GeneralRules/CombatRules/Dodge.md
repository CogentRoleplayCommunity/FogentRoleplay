# Dodge

When an attack is made against a character who is not returning fire or attacking back, the defender can make an Acrobatics Roll vs the attacker's Combat Roll. Any levels over the defender's Dodge wins count as victories for the attacker. The Acrobatics Roll counts for the entire round. A Combat Roll and Dogdge can both be made in a round. If the character takes the Defensive combat modifier, then it is also applied.
