# Defense

Depending on the damage type, different types of defense can be used to resist injuries. A character can then reduce a physical injury level by the equivalent amount of defense they have to that damage type. The only way to injure an opponent with a specific defense is to exceed, or bypass it.

## Physical Defense

A measure of a character's resistance to all physical injuries. A character can wear two pieces of armor in the same category, such as wearing a gambeson under chain mail or a breastplate, which was most certainly done in history. In these circumstances the most efficient ways of defeating a person in armor is grappling them or tripping them and holding them down, just like in real life.
