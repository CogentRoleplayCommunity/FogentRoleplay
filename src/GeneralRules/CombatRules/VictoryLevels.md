# Victory Levels

- Victory levels from physical attacks can be reduced equal to the amount of STR a character has per combat. If STR is negative, the level of physical injury is increased by 1.
- Victory levels from non-physical (i.e. mental or spiritual) attacks can be reduced equal to the amount of INT a character has per combat. If INT is negative, the level of mental/spiritual injury is increased by 1.
- Injuries can be reduced by physical/mental/spiritual defense.
- A character is rendered Incapacitated once they've taken a summed 5 or above injury dice.
- Any lower victory level outcome can be achieved.

## Dice Removal

Whenever you are removing dice from a dice pool (often done after taking an injury), always remove the lowest sided dice first. For instance, d4 dice are always removed first, then d6, and so on.

### Keep your Combat Rolls!

Combat Rolls, Dodge Rolls, Assists Rolls, etc... should be held onto during combat. This is to remember your current victory levels for the round. This is also in case your character loses dice due to injury or they gain disadvantage in that round which turn, which will be taken out of your already rolled dice pool.

### Removing Dice to an already rolled Dice Pool

Whenever losing dice of the same kind, always remove dice from left to right. This is to leave it up to chance if they dice they lost that round punishes or benefits their combat roll for that round. With physical dice, you can just straighten out the dice and begin removing in that order.

## Level 1 victory

### Minor Injury

–1 dice to all physical based dice checks but will naturally heal over the next few days, or faster if treated actively.

### Stagger

Opponent gains the staggered combat modifier. This could be sand thrown in a character face, being shoulder checked, or losing their footing. The opponent has disadvantage rolls until the end of the next round. Movement speed is halved while staggered. The opponent can not benefit from the Defensive modifier while staggered as they can't fully focus on defending themselves.

### Close Combat

Enter/exit close combat. The fight is so close in physical proximity that the character's bodies are pressed up against each other in a grapple or wrestle. A character using a medium (or larger) weapon is considered unarmed. Injury reduction from armor is not applicable while in close combat. Medium weapons can be used in close combat against reach weapons.

The initiator of close combat can release the grapple at any time.  Not available to ranged combat rolls. Once an opponent is grappled, on the same round you can attempt a Lift check determined by your narrator given the size and the weight of your opponent. If successful, you can Move or Shove your opponent.

### Move

Must be initiated while in close combat. Move an enemy in a desired direction. Your movement speed is halved if your opponent is the same size category as you. If the opponent is one size smaller, your movement speed is unchanged. If the opponent is one size larger, you have ¼ of your movement speed. Narrator's discretion to change this distance (i.e. humanoid sized creature weighs as much as a Large category creature as it is made of pure metal/stone).

### Shove

Must be initiated while in close combat. Shove an enemy in a desired direction. Base 5 feet of shoving. Each point in STR gains 5 feet. Each point in Lift gains 2.5 feet. For each size category the opponent is smaller than you, double the distance of the shove. For each size category the opponent is larger than you, half the distance. Narrator's discretion to change this distance (i.e. humanoid sized creature weighs as much as a Large category creature as it is made of pure metal/stone).

## Level 2 victory

### Medium injury

-2 dice to all physical based dice checks and must be treated relatively soon, otherwise further penalties may apply such as infection.

### Disarm

Opponent loses their weapon.

## Level 3 victory

### Serious injury

– 3 dice to all physical based dice checks and the character will die in time if the wound is untreated.

### Trip

Opponent is rendered prone. The opponent has disadvantage on rolls until they get up. Melee attacks made against the downed opponent are at advantage.

A character can declare they are attempting to get up on a round they start prone. While getting up, the opponents movement speed is 0. They are able to regain their footing and remove the prone effect at the end of the round they were getting up. The opponent can not benefit from the Defensive modifier while getting up as they can't fully focus on defending themselves.

Instead of getting up, a character can remain prone. They use their climb speed instead of their movement speed.

## Level 4 Victory

### Fatal injury

– 4 dice to all physical based dice checks, incapacitated, and will die very soon if untreated.

### Dismember

Remove an arm or leg, which also gives a Serious Injury to the opponent. Not available to ranged combat rolls unless magic or explosive projectiles are involved.

### Render Unconscious

Opponent is rendered unconscious by head trauma, blood chokes, etc. Opponent receives a Medium Injury.

## Level 5 victory and higher

### Death blow

An instant kill.

## Status Effects

In Fallen, typical status effects such as being poisoned, frostbitten, bleeding, madness, ect... are just handle elegantly though the injury system. For instance, if you were dealt a Serious injury by mild poison mist, than narratively explain it as a getting a large breath full. If the character instead was dealt a Serious injury by an extremely lethal poison mist, than narratively it would be explained as only getting a small whiff.

The resulting dice penalty act as your status effect debuffing your character until they are resolved. For instance, anti venom might be able to remove the poison injury or warming up by a fire might reduce frostbite from cold damage.
