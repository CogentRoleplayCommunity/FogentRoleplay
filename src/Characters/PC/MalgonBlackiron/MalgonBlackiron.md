## Backstory

Born high in the peaks of the Spine of the world, Malgon learned from an early age what it meant to work as a unit to stay alive. Despite the extreme conditions and the constant threat of monster attacks, Malgon's tribe thrived in the mountains. On his 18th birthday, Malgon left his tribe to take the journey of knowledge, in which young members of the tribe descend the mountains to gather knowledge from the low-landers. The quality and usefulness of the skill the return with and teach determines their position in the tribe.

Life among the low-landers was difficult for Malgon to adjust to. On his travels, he made a fast friend named Burrowbard Stoneseeker, an aged molekin business man who took him under his wing. He gave Malgon work guarding ironwood transport wagons which Burrowbard owned. This gave Malgon ample oppertunities to test his mettle against wandering bandits and monsters.
