## Backstory

Left on the doorstep of a guards barrack in the Crimsonward of the great City of Reddwall as an infant, it is of no surprise that Skuath remembers nothing before Reddwall. Unlike other places on the continent, Reddwall places high importance on aiding all orphaned children. Skuath always had a warm bed, friends, and all he could eat. He received frequent visits from Commander Sarah Royce, who had found him that fateful night. Commander Royce was strong, brave, and kind. Skuath loved Commander Royce and she was a powerful influence on him. As soon as he came of age he joined the Red Legion as a cadet, personally requesting to serve under Commander Royce. Skuath worked harder than he had his entire life. Skuath lived and breathed weapons training, battle tactics and gear maintenance. Skuath loved it, excelling to the top of his class and distinguishing himself with his talent at Galecraft and spearmanship. Skuath was brave, if not a little cocky, but always backed up his boasts with skill. Under Commander Royce's tutelage, Skuath became a true embodiment of a legionary.

Skuath did sometimes wonder where he came from. Who his real parents were and how he ended up on that doorstep all those years ago. But these thoughts were fleeting, as between Commander Royce and his fellow cadets, Skuath already had his family.

However, two weeks after his cadet graduation ceremony, malevolence struck. Commander Royce, always aiding the orphaned wards of the state, was brutally attacked. A young Dhampir serial killer named Helena Monitolie, shattered Royce’s mind leaving her in a coma, and murdered all of Skuath’s classmates while he was off on patrol. Unable to cope with the pure malevolence, something broke in Skuath, never quite healing right. Reddwall, his home for his entire life, became a never ending barrage of painful memories.

Skuath left the guard not quite sure what to do with his life. A local pillar of the community noticed the plight of young Skuath and took him in. He gave him work guarding Ironwood lumber wagons which Burrowbard owned and helped him regain some semblance of purpose as a protector. Any reason to leave Reddwall was good enough for Skuath.
