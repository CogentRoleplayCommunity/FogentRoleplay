## Notes:

## Backstory:

Jing Hu's childhood was abruptly shattered when he fell victim to a kidnapping orchestrated by the secretive Leodelphian martial arts clan known as the Zen Hu. Renowned for their superior martial skills and shadow magic, the Zen Hu earned a fearsome reputation as assassins.

Rather than resorting to the conventional ransom demands, the leader of the Zen Hu recognized Jing Hu's exceptional martial prowess even at his tender age. Instead of returning him to his parents, they decided to induct him into their clandestine clan. Jing Hu flourished under their tutelage, becoming a formidable warrior and a dedicated member of the Zen Hu.

During one fateful mission, Jing Hu unknowingly carried out an assignment that resulted in the unintentional demise of his Dhampir biological parents, who belonged to the formidable Loughty clan. The Loughty clan, being powerful nobles, sought revenge by dispatching a rival assassins guild, the Wicker Men, to annihilate the Zen Hu while they slept. Few survived the attack and Jing Hu was grievously wounded, left on the brink of death.

At dawn, Elinor Shortwick, fueled by vengeance for her family's demise at the hands of the Zen Hu, discovered the aftermath of the deadly night. Recognizing the shared tragedy of losing their families, she extended compassion to Jing Hu. She patch him up enough to save his life and brought him back to the home of Burrowbard Stoneseeker, Elinor's patron who supports her quest to find her parents killers.

Jing Hu while recovering from his grievous wounds, Jing Hu had a crisis of purpose. His clan, the Zen Hu, who had kidnapped him, ordered him to murdered his parents, were no more. There was no vengeance to be had as they were already all dead. In those dark moments, Burrowbard Stoneseeker help Jing Hu find purpose again helping Elinor. Though he could not get justice for his own kin, maybe by helping another he could find purpose.

In gratitude for Elinor's act of kindness, Jing Hu pledged a life oath to her, vowing to protect her from any adversary, regardless of the peril. United by their common quest, they now journey together, determined to uncover the puppeteer responsible for orchestrating the events that led to the deaths of both their families.
