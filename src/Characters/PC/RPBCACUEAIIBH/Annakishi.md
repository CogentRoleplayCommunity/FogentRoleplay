## UNFINISHED... Read but don't publish yet!

- The problem I have is that:
A) Her having a very intense royal training and whole hartedly taking advantage of that before even starting her advanture, doesn't make sense at Initiate tier. She's bred and trained kikki royalty just like Fanacrio but trained to become a queen (slightly different purpose in the hive), and she is about the same age, not an untrained worker having to find out everthing on her own. She is not a rebel, she didn't ran away so she would lack training. She is completely in line with the hive's goals, and at the end of her training she had to make a choice to stay and compete with physically larger and stronger peers, whom she couldn't reliably subdue with her magic or leave peacefully and build her own empire. She simply chose option B when she felt that she was becoming a drain on the hive's resources. Therefore making her magically any less capable then Fanacrio, doesn't make any sense to me. The hive wouldn't let her go without giving her the training, weapon, and food she can carry to survive and build a new hive. (It's basic hive minded behavior: survival of the hive comes first, survival of the species second, both of which are valid honorable goals that the hive spends resources on.)
B) Her story doens't make sense at Initiate tier with each fellcraft starting at -1, even if I spent all her skill points on it (which I shouldn't cause her having been trained suggest that she has at least has basic survial abilities and potentially other physical skills too), she just wouldn be able to get far, compelling common people to give her resoucres or help her out as her story says.
- I'm happy to play an Initiate tier character if it make sense, but I'm not thrilled to play a character who's story doesn't make sense at any tier (I just can't get into character if it doesn't make sense.), which is why I don't roll for disabling characteristics and spend 2 days thinking on it. Nor do I wanna spend extra few days to come up with another killer character idea just to fit in with other initiate tier characters. Spending points is easy, creating another interesing character isn't(at least not for me). At worst I will patiently wait for an open spot on a team of adept characters. (I'm not in a rush, I have my own game and other open source projects to develop while I'm waiting, and I can still enjoy watching others play as I did for years. So no pressure.)

- As an afterthought: I thing it would be a good idea to test whether I like playing the game with a character that can actually do something impressive, in maybe a few sessions before I fully commit to a potentially long series starting with an Initiate tier character. I don't wanna potentially ruin the game for others by abruptly leaving in case I don't like it. Her goal is to settle, so finding her nesting place is a graceful way to retire her.

## Notes
For those who struggle with naming(like I do):
Pick a name eg. Ana on another language eg. Hungarian(my native language): Anna
Apply a naming formula eg: {Non-English name} + aki/iki + shi; If {Non-English name} ends in "a" or "i" remove one.
Her name: Annakishi :D

## Appearance

Age: 19

Race: Kikki (Chitinkin)

Height: 4' 9" ...not counting a poir of foot long antennae waving from the top of her head the top few inches slightly bent.

Weight: ~ 92 lb

Body: Slender, humanoid with obvious feminin curves. She has 4 arms sprouting laterally from the top of her torso, the upper 2 arms end in chelae (pinchers) while the lower 2 in human hands covered in carapace from the outside, but soft on the inside. She has slightly bulging wing muscles on the top of her back and 4 translucent wings neatly tucked on her back, the top 2 being somewhat longer then the bottom 2, and purple accented natural carapace protecting the outsid of her limbs and torso.

Hair: She wears her long wavy brown hair loose.

Eyes: That's a long story... :D She has big black compound eyes (multi lens bug eyes), with it's natural advantages and disadvantages.

Additional Details:

Bug eye Advantages:
- Wider then average visual range (180°).
- High sensitivity. (She can see at starlight at night, or distant campfire lit by the enemy she's scouting, or faintly glowing flora in caves, since her kind live in underground hives.)
- Light polarisation (Her eyes don't need to adjust to brightness or dimmness.)
- This enables her to react about 5x faster then humans.

(Realistically she should be able to catch an arrow at CL2, or dodge a normal blow at CL1, but it's far easier to just size the challange level to humans, because that's what we are and spend her attribute points on reflex.
Her eyes meant to help her avoid obstacles and catch prey in flight, but her kind live most of their lives underground, their vision being complemented by their antennae for tunnel navigation by use of feromones.)

Bug eye Disadvanages:
- Unable to see small detail (She can't solve puzzles, can't appreciate intricate detail and never learnt to read, cause she sees regular hand written characters in about 4x4 pixel resolution.)
- She can see a moving humanoid figure far away, she can even see the form raising a weapon to shoot, and react in time, but she can only identify a perspon or object from about 30 foot or closer by sight. (10 meters or closer)

(The closest analog to her vision are low resolution high framerate cameras with fisheye lenses, and automatic IR filter, but no active IR for night vision, just highly sensitive passive IR.
Her eyes don't normally glow, she can only see in complete darkness by means of polycraft transformation.)

Antennae:
- She has a good sense of smell (having both human nose and antennae), and feromones bugs use to communicate.

Extra arms and wings:
I don't recall ever seeing a genetically 4 legged bug of any kind, kiki should have at least 6 or more limbs, so her kind does, even if she's basically a mix of several different bugs. ;)
She is not strong enough to fly far without polycrat to boost her strength, but she can jump really big, or glide and also maneuver swiftly in flight.
Her wings buzz loudly on a low pitch like large bugs.

## Disposition

- Alert
- Determined
- Commanding, but she doesn't really care whether you did what she said as long as the outcome is good for the team.
- Hive minded but generally accepting towards anyone friendly to her.
- She may promptly put you in place if you try to stop her, and may get vengeful if you actually succeed.
- If everything fails, she may give you a second chance to obey her tomorrow, cause she really doesn't wanna be alone.

## Beliefs/Morality

- The hive is everything to her. She cherishes the "us" and doesn't give a shit about the "them". The "us" being hersrlf and everyone who accepts her command, or yields to her mindcraft, and the "them" means everyone who succeeds to resists her.
- She is not driven by greed, she relies on the group's resources and she is willing to share hers with those of "us" in neeed, expecting or if must compelling people to do or provide what she or one of "us" needs, and not much more then that.
- She has no problem doing what others may seem as wrong, she may go shoping without money and shamelessly compel merchants to grant free supply/resources to "us", preferably with free immediate shipping.

Just like a Morraki queen should be. ;)

## Goals/Aspirations

- She's on a quest looking for a "suitable" nesting place to build her empire. (She is very choosy, so pretty much no place is good enough for her. Which is why she wondered out of Caurus.) :D

## Backstory

She is a young queen alate (with no servants yet), from a Morraki hive. She is less experienced, and not as tough as she thinks she is. ;) (Her perception of her abilities and future is inflated by Mirage, whoch she got hooked on after leaving the hive, and wonering thtough the great emptyness, compelling a few traders on her way to give her what she needed, food, including transport, and a good supply of Mirage.)
She was the shortest and physically weakest among her rivals for the throne so she left the hive willingly to establish her own hive. As customary, she was expected to survice on her own and would never be allowed to return. She was sent out with the blessing of the current queen, a short staff weapon she was trained with, and can also use as a walking aid, as well as basic survival equipment, and food she could cary.
She's not entirely helpless though, her physical inferiority forced her to become adept at her fellcraft, which she uses frequently and shamelessly to her advantage. She also has a silver degger that she keeps hidden even from her team mates. That is her secret weapon she may use in mortal danger. (She stole that from her own hive, knowing that she can not return, and any sane queen would take the opportunity to do the same.)
She got hooked on Mirage during her journey through the great emptiness. She has copious amount of Mirage at her disposal from a merchant she compelled. She is a functional addict, taking very small doses, just enough to keep her going, but she does get depressed if and when she runs out and realizes that she left more then a year ago, and traveled far but still doesn't have a hive or even a "suitable" a place to settle...
