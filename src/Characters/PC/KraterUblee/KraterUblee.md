## Backstory

Krater grew up in the vast Ironwood forest to the east of Reddwall known as Irongrove. His family worked at one of the remote lumberyards responsible for the harvesting and exporting of ironwood. Tragedy struck Karter's family when he was but a boy, when his father was killed in a tragic accident. Krater, traumatized by the event, began to see delusions of his father as he was in life walking around. He will ofter talk with him, even though his mother his told him he isn't real. Krater knows he isn't material, though believes his father's spirit follows him.

Left without a father figure, Burrow Bard Stoneseeker, the owner and financier of the lumberyard operation took Krater under his wing the best he could. Krater emulated his now father figure, becoming stubborn and difficult to compromise with.

Krater grew to be quite the lumberman and proficient with his axe, working hard and always meeting quota. When his mother's health began deteriorating, he saved his salary, enough to eventually move him and his mom towards Reddwall to seek better healthcare for his mother's strange disease. Burrowbard, kind as ever, helped them find a place, haggle down the price, and would frequently check in on the two. Krater, well versed in the Ironwood trade, worked for Burrowbard at one of his Ironwood export docks.
