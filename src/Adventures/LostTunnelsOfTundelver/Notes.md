- They should speak to Linnet at the Beastshield Coster about the supplies they found in the cave, as there may be a reward in it.

- Gentle: Barton has an old azmatic cat named buddy who audible wheezes. Kindly be gentle with my buddy their, Sister Garaele says he is Ae-es-a-matic, which means he don't breath good.
- Noble: Bandaged hand, split lip, black eye. He got into a scuffle with them lavender boys recently.
- Barton knows the Stoneseeker brothers treasure seekers
- Thinks the townmaster is a coward
- Hates the Lancers and could get a community reward if the party could chase them out of town

Molly mousekin, assignat manager:

- Knows sister Garela is upset
- Saw someone spooky in the graveyard who ran off with some bones
- Saw the black spider
- She can ask them if they are adventures and if they are here to collect the bounty on the ogrekin bandits.
- Sister Gareles powers haven't been working
- Sheriffs wife and son left last weak suddenly
- Met a woman on the roof tops exploring the roof tops yesterday

SIster Grelana can't use her magic to speak to the dead as their is a powerful spirit in the forest.

- When the party meets her, trying to talk to dead lancer. Intruded by the banshee
- Wants the Lancers gone

## Ideas

- Arinoth dad is old Arinoth, hence why he was mistaken for his father and why his father's spirit is interacting with him.
- Blackspider kills a lancer spies and offers to trade with the party
-
