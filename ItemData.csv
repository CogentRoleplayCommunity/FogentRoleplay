Asher’s Arms Swordbreaker,1,"Small Slashing Blade, Thrown Small Blade",Swordbreaker Blade Catch,Fine,18/18,1,?,"A fine swordbreaker purchased from Asher’s Arm, a well regarded establishment in Reddwall known for their grayish blue steel. Swordbreakers were a favorite weapon of Lord Flint Reddington. He commissioned many swordbreakers just like this one for use in dueling.

Swordbreakers, often wielded offhand to a main hand sword. They are designed to catch and bind the opponent's blade, leaving the opponent open for a decisive attack from the main hand weapon."

House Roseblood isn't as wealthy as it once was during the height of the witch queen's reign. As a result, they do not have the coin for the finest craftsmen for children’s swords, owing to the more modest nature of this sword."

Hew,1,Medium Hafted Axe,Splinter,Excellent,21/21,4,?,"""When you chop wood, splinters fly.""  - Anonymous

An unassuming double bladed, rusty, yet excellently crafted battleaxe both as versatile at chopping wood as chopping skulls.

Runecraft scholars have traced the origin of this axe to the first Fellkin who began harvesting the great iron woods of Reddland. Needing a tool that was both capable of felling the great iron woods and fending back the monstrous Leshens that roamed the forest, this weapon was forged."
Char,1,"Thrusting Greatsword, Slashing Greatsword",Fire Repair and Enhancement,Fine,18/18,6,?,"""It has been in the family for a bit, passed down from father to son. It’ll be yours one day junior. Who knows, you might need it someday."" -Destin Shaffer Sr.

An apparently mundane greatsword with a partially shattered tip “acquired” and used by Destin Shaffer. Destin took this sword when he left his mother and father. Taken because it was the least valuable weapon at his parents' blacksmith shop as his guilt prevented him from taking anything nicer. He always wondered why his step-father kept the hunk of junk leaning up against the wall.

Destin used this blade in his time as a mercenary. He had plenty of opportunities to claim more elegant weapons from fallen opponents, though he could never part with the blade.

During Destin's confrontation with the Demon Helena, he sacrificed the damaged blade for one more powerful strike to in a desperate attempt defend the fleeing prisoner’s and his friends. The sword shattered, though somehow managed to hold itself together, surging with red heat visible through the cracks. Recently, Destin has discovered that the weapon seems capable of repairing itself under extreme heat.

Shattered and broken, Destin continues to carry this blade."
Epilogue,1,"Medium Thrusting Sword, Medium Slashing Sword",Ending,Excellent,21/21,2,?,"""There is no real ending. It's just a place where you stop the story.""

This excellent slender bastard sword is perfectly balanced. Nimble, thin, and razor sharp, this is a fine sword.

A relatively unknown Runecraft to the wider populace, this sword is highly debated by scholars of war and Runecrafts. ""Ending"", ""Epilogue"", ""The Last Word"", ""An Ending to things"", ect… are all names for what scholars believe is the same sword recorded across many myths from various cultures, long into the past. Always described as a slender, long, graceful sword as easy to use in one hand as two. This sword seems to end up in the hands of ill fated rogues and rebels.

Killing with this weapon seems to mysteriously decapitate the victim's head from their bodies. In some tales it is only when the user of the sword deals a killing blow, while in older tales a single nick from the blade would lead to instant decapitation. Users report seeing flashes of the life they’ve cut off and all the generations in an instant.

 Appearing in various forms throughout history such as a rapier or slender long sword. This has led some scholars to argue that this sword is in fact multiple swords with similar effects. The Battle Scholars of the Dawn Empire had this weapon in their great collection in Crossroads long ago, and it was mysteriously lost. They recorded the weapon as only decapitating on a death blow, testing it on condemned criminals. Such a weak effect led to reduced research on the weapon while it was in their possession. However, they never were able to replicate its Runecraft, odd for such a weak effect. No weapon has ever been recorded as having a similar effect, leaving some scholars to ponder if there is more to this Runecraft…"

My true mentor. My guiding moonlight."" - Unknown

A mythic arcane longsword discovered by the first Sirens who first inhabited what is known as Reddland today. Said to be a sign of divine favor to those chosen by the Moon Presence of Terra. As a manifestation of the Moon Presence on Terra, the wielder gains access to the wisdom and power of the moon presence.

When moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. Few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort.

Princess Vex'ahlia Reddington was gifted this sword upon her return to Reddland by her mother, who claimed it was her birth right. Lady Reddington used to tell tales of Vex'ahlia's birth. Lady Reddington wanted nothing more than a child, so when her medical and academic knowledge failed her, she prayed to the Moon Presence to protect the unborn child within her. Vex'ahlia was born with white hair the color of the full moon. One night when Lady Veronica went to check on the baby Vex'ahlia, this sword was leaning up against her crib playing the most wonderful lullaby she'd ever heard."
Adversary - Damaged,1,Radiance Conduit,Light Bound,Fine,18/18,1,?,"""Awake, arise, or be forever Fallen…"" - Words of the Bright Lord

A masterfully crafted golden sword hilt, that appears to be damaged from a tremendous impact, leaving the hilt crack and leaking light. Used as a radiance conduit to focus ones abilities, generally in the shape of a sword blade.

Sword of Luc Lightbringer. The hilt acts as a Brightcraft focus, allowing for devastating radiant attack. Luc has had this sword his entire life, a mysterious gift from when he was too young to remember. In many ways, this sword and Luc are one in the same. Elegant, bright, and extremely dangerous. Luc has spent his entire entire life learning the abilities of this artifact, though even he does not fully understand the weapon…

This sword was used in the execution of Helena by Uhtred Storm at Luc's order, though it was only used to subdue her and did not deal the final blow."
