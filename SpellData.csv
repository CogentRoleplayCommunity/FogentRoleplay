It could resemble your own voice, another person's voice, the mighty roar of a lion, the rhythmic beat of drums, or any other sound you desire. The chosen sound will persist continuously throughout the spell's duration, or you can produce discrete sounds at different moments before the spell concludes. If you choose to create an image of an object, such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest, it cannot exceed a 5 foot cube.
