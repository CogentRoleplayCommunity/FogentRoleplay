# Fling

You pick a single object within your effect range that weighs 5 pounds or less. This chosen object is then propelled in a straight line, following a direction of your choice. It will come to a halt if it collides with a solid surface before reaching its full distance.

Should the object's path intersect with a creature, that creature is required to make a Acrobatics check against the combat roll to evade it. Failing the check results in the object striking the target, causing it to stop in its tracks.
