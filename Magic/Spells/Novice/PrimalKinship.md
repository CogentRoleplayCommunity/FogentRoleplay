# Primal Kinship

You establish a telepathic connection with a friendly or charmed beast you touch. The spell is ineffective if the creature's Intelligence is 1 or higher. As long as you and the beast remain within range of each other, the telepathic link remains active. Through this connection, the creature can comprehend your telepathic messages and convey simple emotions and ideas in return.
