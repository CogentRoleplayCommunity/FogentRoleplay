# Noiseless Picture

![](NoiselessPicture.png)

This spell allows you to conjure a sound or an image of an object within a certain range, and it remains in existence for the duration of the spell. The illusion will also cease to exist if you dismiss it using an action, or if you cast the spell again.

When creating a sound, you have control over its volume, which can range from a soft whisper to a piercing scream. The sound can take the form of your voice, someone else's voice, the roar of a lion, the beating of drums, or any other sound of your choosing. Throughout the spell's duration, the sound will persist continuously, or you can opt to produce discrete sounds at different moments before the spell's conclusion.

If you decide to create an image of an object, such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest, its size cannot exceed that of a cube determined below. However, this image lacks the ability to produce sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. If someone attempts to interact with the image physically, they will discover it to be an illusion, as objects can pass through it.

Should a creature use its action to closely examine the sound or image, they can potentially discern that it is an illusion by succeeding in an General Knowledge check against your spell save DC. If the creature successfully identifies the illusion, it will appear faint to them.
